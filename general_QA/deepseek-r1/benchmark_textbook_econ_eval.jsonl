Incomplete information (highlighted in the context) prevents full visibility into managerial decisions, allowing agents to manipulate short-term indicators (e.g., cutting R&D to boost profits) while harming long-term value. This creates a misalignment between labor market signals and true owner interests.\n\nStep 3: **General constraints**\n- Both mechanisms assume rational market responses, but costly monitoring (explicitly noted in the context) limits owners' ability to verify agent actions. This reduces the effectiveness of market-based discipline mechanisms. Additionally, managers may prioritize takeover defense strategies (e.g., poison pills) over value creation, further undermining these solutions.", "error": null}}

Households face their own IBC: \\(\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = W_0 + \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\frac{Y_t - T_t}{(1 + r)^t}\\), where \\(C_t\\) is consumption, \\(W_0\\) initial wealth, and \\(Y_t\\) income. If Ricardian equivalence fails (as in Helpman & Razin, 1987), changes in \\(T_t\\) or \\(S_t\\) directly alter household wealth perceptions.\n\nStep 3: Analyze interactions. A stabilization program (e.g., cutting \\(G_t\\) or reducing inflation tax) modifies the government's IBC. Households interpret this as a wealth increase (due to non-Ricardian effects), raising \\(C_t\\). In Rebelo & Végh (1995), reduced government tradable consumption raises private tradable consumption, causing real appreciation (via higher non-tradable demand) and improved current account (lower public absorption of tradables).\n\nStep 4: Equilibrium outcomes. The joint satisfaction of both IBCs determines variables like consumption, real exchange rates, and current account. For example, fiscal tightening (lower \\(G_t\\)) relaxes the government's IBC but induces a private consumption boom if households perceive higher net wealth, leading to real appreciation and investment/current account adjustments as resources shift between sectors.", "error": null}}

Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics. The natural logarithm is denoted as $y = \\log(x)$ and is defined only for $x > 0$.

There is no a priori guide as to what is the maximum length of the lag. 2. As one estimates successive lags, there are fewer degrees of freedom left, making statistical inference somewhat shaky. 3. More importantly, in economic time series data, successive values (lags) tend to be highly correlated; hence multicollinearity rears its ugly head. 4. The sequential search for the lag length opens the researcher to the charge of data mining.\nKoyck has proposed an ingenious method of estimating distributed-lag models. Suppose we start with the infinite lag distributed-lag model (17.3.1). Assuming that the $\\beta$’s are all of the same sign, Koyck assumes that they decline geometrically as follows: $$\\beta_{k}=\\beta_{0}\\lambda^{k}\\qquad k=0,1,\\ldots$$ where $\\lambda$, such that $0<\\lambda<1$, is known as the rate of decline, or decay, of the distributed lag and where $1-\\lambda$ is known as the speed of adjustment.\nThe median lag is the time required for the first half, or 50 percent, of the total change in $Y$ following a unit sustained change in $X$. For the Koyck model, the median lag is as follows: $$\\text{Koyck model: Median lag}=-\\frac{\\log 2}{\\log \\lambda}$$ Thus, if $\\lambda=0.2$ the median lag is 0.4306, but if $\\lambda=0.8$ the median lag is 3.1067.\nProvided all $\\beta_{k}$ are positive, the mean, or average, lag is defined as $$\\text{Mean lag}=\\frac{\\sum_{0}^{\\infty}k\\beta_{k}}{\\sum_{0}^{\\infty}\\beta_{k}}$$ which is simply the weighted average of all the lags involved, with the respective $\\beta$ coefficients serving as weights. For the Koyck model the mean lag is $$\\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}$$\n\nThis section discusses the estimation of distributed-lag models, which are used to analyze the effect of past values of an explanatory variable on the current value of the dependent variable.

For example, if the instrument (e.g., draft lottery number) is weakly correlated with the endogenous variable (education) but inadvertently correlated with the error term (via omitted variables like schooling decisions), the IV estimates become inconsistent.\n\nStep 4: Weak instruments also risk underidentification. The context notes that if the instrument cannot sufficiently explain variation in the endogenous variable (e.g., money supply growth weakly predicting inflation), the model lacks a valid source of exogenous variation, rendering IV estimation infeasible or biased.", "error": null}}

The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

Since OLS = GLS in this case, OLS achieves the Gauss-Markov efficiency bound despite non-spherical errors. This eliminates the usual efficiency advantage of GLS over OLS when $\\mathbf{X}$ aligns with $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$'s eigenvectors.\n\nStep 4: Variance structure simplification. The diagonal variance matrix $\\sigma^2\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_K$ implies uncorrelated coefficient estimates, simplifying hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n\nSummary: Kruskal's Theorem implies that strategic specification of $\\mathbf{X}$ using $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$'s eigenvectors allows OLS to retain full efficiency while avoiding GLS's computational and estimation challenges. This highlights the importance of covariate selection/transformation aligned with error structure in certain applications.", "error": null}}

Since the tax directly governs the firm’s output choice, agents cannot bargain over $h$ independently of $q$, eliminating post-tax inefficiencies.\n\nStep 4: Compare efficiency. Externality taxation ($\\tau$) is theoretically precise but vulnerable to post-tax bargaining, undermining efficiency. Output taxation ($t$) is less direct but avoids bargaining distortions by tying the externality to a taxed variable ($q$), ensuring stable social optimality.", "error": null}}

Step 3: Matrix singularity consequence. This linear dependency reduces the rank of the $3\\times3$ residual covariance matrix $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$, making it singular (rank ≤ 2) in finite samples. Step 4: Numerical invariance explanation.
