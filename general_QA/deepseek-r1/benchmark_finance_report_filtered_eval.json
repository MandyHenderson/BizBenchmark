Splunk’s security orchestration, automation, and response, or SOAR, software is geared toward triaging these issues automatically.\nWe believe Splunk warrants a narrow economic moat thanks to high customer switching costs. We view more than 90% of Fortune 100 firms using Splunk’s offerings as a vote of confidence in its enterprise product lineup. Further, we are impressed by Splunk’s strong cloud dollar-based net retention (DBNR) that has consistently remained above 120%.\nOur fair value estimate for Splunk is $144 based on the pending acquisition by Cisco. On a standalone basis, our fair value estimate would revert to $125 per share, implying a 2024 enterprise value to sales multiple of 6.5 times. With secular tailwinds behind its back, we forecast Splunk’s revenue growing at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the next five years.\n\nSplunk is a cloud-first software company that focuses on analyzing machine data. The company is a major player in two markets: security and full-stack monitoring & analysis. The San Francisco-based firm focuses on enterprise clients, with more than 90% of the Fortune 100 using its solutions. The firm’s top line consists of the sale of software licenses, cloud subscriptions, and maintenance and support.",

Since U.S. shares are USD-denominated, their fair value is insulated from EUR-based currency risks, leaving the $48 estimate unaffected.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate offsetting factors.\nWhile Q1 results were strong, the expectation that COVID-19 tailwinds will turn into headwinds likely offset any upward pressure on the U.S. share valuation, maintaining the $48 estimate.",

Total assets grew 25% ($3,386B to $4,233B) alongside equity expansion. While growing equity base supports capital adequacy (leverage ratio improved from ~12.1x to ~11.1x), rapid asset growth could mask risks: (1) potential dilution of returns if new assets earn lower margins, (2) increased exposure to credit/market risks in expanding portfolios.\n\nStep 3: Identify overlooked risks. Morningstar may underestimate: (1) Concentration risk in commercial lending (not explicitly quantified in context), (2) Interest rate risk given the bank's large fixed-income holdings, (3) Regulatory risk from evolving capital requirements despite current strong CET1 ratios, (4) Sustainability of ROE if net interest margin compression occurs amid Fed policy shifts. The stable Price/Book ratio (1.8x) and medium uncertainty rating may insufficiently reflect these nonlinear risks.",

The context highlights that the global markets business (a component of its global wholesale operations) underperformed due to failure to capitalize on fixed-income trading opportunities, indicating operational inefficiency or competitive weaknesses in this segment.\n\nStep 2: Assess the financial impact. Excluding a one-time gain of JPY 28 billion from the sale of affiliate shares, Nomura’s quarterly ROE would have been 5.7%—below the 8.5% annualized ROE (which equals its cost of equity). This implies that core operations in the global wholesale business are not generating sufficient returns to meet investor expectations, eroding long-term profitability.\n\nStep 3: Analyze competitive positioning. The underperformance in fixed-income trading—a critical revenue driver for global investment banks—suggests Nomura is losing ground to competitors in key markets. This weakens its ability to attract clients and retain market share, further pressuring margins.\n\nStep 4: Long-term implications. Persistent underperformance in the global wholesale segment risks structural profitability declines, as the business relies on one-off gains (like the NRI stake sale) to meet ROE targets. A price-to-book ratio of 0.59x reflects market skepticism about sustainable value creation, limiting access to capital and growth opportunities.",

Large institutional purchases often signal confidence in the company's fundamentals or growth prospects, which could positively influence market perception. Step 3: Compare with other holders. While Vanguard's smaller incremental change (+32,829 shares) reflects passive index tracking, Champlain's active decision to acquire a significant stake may attract attention from other investors. Step 4: Consider ownership concentration. At 0.59%, Champlain becomes a notable shareholder but not a controlling entity, suggesting their investment is likely based on valuation rather than activist intentions. Step 5: Evaluate market impact. This transaction could improve liquidity perceptions and potentially lead to herd behavior among institutional investors, though the limited percentage ownership prevents direct control implications.",

Pembina’s adjusted ROIC (6.2-6.4%) is significantly below its unadjusted ROIC and the peer average (7.4%), implying non-operational factors (e.g., one-time adjustments) artificially inflate its reported ROIC. Step 4: Cross-reference with profitability. Pembina’s net margins (17.0-17.6%) exceed the industry average (8.5-8.6%), but its ROIC underperformance suggests inefficiency in capital deployment (e.g., higher asset base or suboptimal investments). Step 5: Consider leverage. Pembina’s debt/total capital (~28.8% in 2023) is lower than peers like Enbridge (128.8%), reducing financial risk but potentially limiting ROIC upside from leverage.

The market structure incentivizes mutual restraint: both firms avoid competing away returns above the cost of capital, favoring stable pricing and profit preservation over destructive competition.  \nConclusion: Key factors include Fair Isaac’s pricing power, high barriers to substitution, strategic alignment among credit bureaus, and oligopolistic interdependence that discourages aggressive price competition.",

    "merged_original_paper_extracted_texts": [
      "We are reaffirming our narrow moat and stable moat trend ratings. Fanning leaves with a mixed record during his 12 years as CEO. He oversaw two of the industry's largest and most ambitious projects in several decades—the Kemper (Mississippi) coal gasification plant and two new units at the Vogtle (Georgia) nuclear plant. However, each project ran into financial and operational challenges that ultimately led to shareholder losses. The Kemper project was scrapped while the Vogtle project is set to start operation this year at nearly double the cost and several years behind the initial schedule. Southern's strategic shift under Fanning to decarbonize its power generation fleet marks one of the company's biggest transformations in its century-long history. We expect Womack—and Fanning, who will remain board chairman—to continue this strategy, positioning Southern for a long runway of growth. Energy demand growth in the Southeast, continued constructive rate regulation in Georgia, and Southern's $8 billion annual capital investment plan support our 6% annual earnings growth outlook. We expect dividend growth to accelerate in 2024. Through year-end 2022, Southern shareholders have realized a 220% return, including dividends, with Fanning as CEO, trailing the 240% total return of the Morningstar US Utilities Sector Index during the same time period. We think the stock is slightly overvalued as of Jan. 4 based on our $67 per share fair value estimate.",
      "At the heart of our valuation system is a detailed projection of a company’s future cash flows, resulting from our analysts’ research.

Moreover, we think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows presents a better lens for viewing cyclical companies, high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (e.g., mines), or companies expected to generate negative earnings over the next few years.

      "The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm’s long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm’s cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",
      "Our model is divided into three distinct stages: Stage I: Explicit Forecast In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending. Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to derive our annual free cash flow forecast. Stage II: Fade The second stage of our model is the period it will take the company’s return on new invested capital—the return on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage. Stage III: Perpetuity Once a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any growth or decline or investment in the business neither creates nor destroys value and that any new investment provides a return in line with estimated WACC. Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present value of expected future cash flows. Because we are modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash available to provide a return to all capital providers—we discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using expected future proportionate long-term, market-value weights."

    "question_context": "We are reaffirming our narrow moat and stable moat trend ratings. Fanning leaves with a mixed record during his 12 years as CEO. He oversaw two of the industry's largest and most ambitious projects in several decades—the Kemper (Mississippi) coal gasification plant and two new units at the Vogtle (Georgia) nuclear plant. However, each project ran into financial and operational challenges that ultimately led to shareholder losses. The Kemper project was scrapped while the Vogtle project is set to start operation this year at nearly double the cost and several years behind the initial schedule. Southern's strategic shift under Fanning to decarbonize its power generation fleet marks one of the company's biggest transformations in its century-long history. We expect Womack—and Fanning, who will remain board chairman—to continue this strategy, positioning Southern for a long runway of growth. Energy demand growth in the Southeast, continued constructive rate regulation in Georgia, and Southern's $8 billion annual capital investment plan support our 6% annual earnings growth outlook. We expect dividend growth to accelerate in 2024. Through year-end 2022, Southern shareholders have realized a 220% return, including dividends, with Fanning as CEO, trailing the 240% total return of the Morningstar US Utilities Sector Index during the same time period.

This process ultimately culminates in our single-point star rating.",
      "The concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.",
      "Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm's cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.",
      "When considering a company's moat, we also assess whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit on a cumulative or midcycle basis.

The Morningstar Rating for stocks identifies stocks trading at an uncertainty-adjusted discount or premium to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount to their fair values whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.\nFour key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process ultimately culminates in our single-point star rating.\nThe concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.\nCompanies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm's cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.\nWhen considering a company's moat, we also assess whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit on a cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the probability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not characterize the company as possessing an economic moat.\nTo assess the sustainability of excess profits, analysts perform ongoing assessments of the moat trend. A firm's moat trend is positive in cases where we think its sources of competitive advantage are growing stronger; stable where we don't anticipate changes to competitive advantages over the next several years; or negative when we see signs of deterioration.\nCombining our analysts' financial forecasts with the firm's economic moat helps us assess how long returns on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm's cost of capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value. Our model is divided into three distinct stages: Stage I: Explicit Forecast, Stage II: Fade, Stage III: Perpetuity.\nIn Stage I, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending. Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes, or EBI, and the net new investment, or NNI, to derive our annual free cash flow forecast.\nThe second stage of our model is the period it will take the company's return on new invested capital—the return on capital of the next dollar invested—to decline until the perpetuity stage is reached. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm's cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage.\nOnce a company's marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula.

Banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup (with ~1% SCB increases) would need to retain more earnings rather than distribute them via dividends or buybacks.\n\nStep 3: The context explicitly states that a 'share repurchase boom' is unlikely despite sector resilience. Higher SCBs constrain capital return flexibility, forcing banks to prioritize regulatory compliance over aggressive capital distribution strategies.\n\nStep 4: Banks with larger SCB increases (e.g., M&T) face greater pressure to limit capital returns compared to peers with smaller adjustments, potentially impacting investor expectations for dividends and stock buyback programs.",

Conversely, a firm with independent board oversight ensuring disciplined investments and sustainable dividends might earn an 'Exemplary' rating.\n\nStep 3: Link governance impact to rating criteria. Analysts would assess whether governance structures directly influence the quality of capital allocation decisions in the three focus areas, adjusting the rating accordingly based on forward-looking material risks or benefits.",

Morningstar’s Uncertainty Rating determines the required margin of safety (discount to fair value) for a stock.

The Star Rating system assigns ratings based on how the current market price compares to Morningstar’s fair value estimate, adjusted by the required margin of safety derived from the Uncertainty Rating.\\nStep 3: Interpret a 5-star rating.

      "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the link between Uncertainty Rating and margin of safety. Morningstar’s Uncertainty Rating determines the required margin of safety (discount to fair value) for a stock. Higher uncertainty demands a larger discount before a recommendation is made.\nStep 2: Connect margin of safety to Star Ratings. The Star Rating system assigns ratings based on how the current market price compares to Morningstar’s fair value estimate, adjusted by the required margin of safety derived from the Uncertainty Rating.\nStep 3: Interpret a 5-star rating. A 5-star rating indicates the stock’s market price is trading at a discount large enough to meet or exceed the margin of safety required for its Uncertainty Rating level. This implies Morningstar views the stock as significantly undervalued relative to its risk profile.\nStep 4: Significance for investors.

While hyperscale customers often sign long-term contracts (potentially justifying low churn), this concentration exposes GDS to renegotiation risks and limits pricing power.\\n\\nStep 2: Assess the validity of low churn claims\\nManagement's low churn narrative must be weighed against: (1) The capital-intensive nature of data center migration (which creates switching costs), versus (2) The possibility that hyperscalers could build their own infrastructure over time, especially given GDS's Tier-1 city focus where land/power are constrained.\\n\\nStep 3: Examine moat components\\nMorningstar's no-moat rating likely reflects: (1) Lack of unique technological advantage in data center operations, (2) High replicability of its build-to-suit model with hyperscale commitments, and (3) Rising power costs (mentioned in guidance) eroding cost structure advantages.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider guidance downgrade implications\\nThe reduced 2021 EBITDA guidance (+35% YoY growth notwithstanding) and increased capex highlight execution risks. The combination of slower customer move-ins and higher costs suggests vulnerability to operational leverage - a critical flaw for moat assessment in capital-intensive businesses.\\n\\nStep 5: Final evaluation\\nWhile customer stickiness through contracts provides short-term stability, the extreme concentration (44.4% from 2 clients) and lack of differentiation in a competitive hyperscale-driven market justify Morningstar's no-moat rating.

While hyperscale customers often sign long-term contracts (potentially justifying low churn), this concentration exposes GDS to renegotiation risks and limits pricing power.\n\nStep 2: Assess the validity of low churn claims\nManagement's low churn narrative must be weighed against: (1) The capital-intensive nature of data center migration (which creates switching costs), versus (2) The possibility that hyperscalers could build their own infrastructure over time, especially given GDS's Tier-1 city focus where land/power are constrained.\n\nStep 3: Examine moat components\nMorningstar's no-moat rating likely reflects: (1) Lack of unique technological advantage in data center operations, (2) High replicability of its build-to-suit model with hyperscale commitments, and (3) Rising power costs (mentioned in guidance) eroding cost structure advantages.\n\nStep 4: Consider guidance downgrade implications\nThe reduced 2021 EBITDA guidance (+35% YoY growth notwithstanding) and increased capex highlight execution risks. The combination of slower customer move-ins and higher costs suggests vulnerability to operational leverage - a critical flaw for moat assessment in capital-intensive businesses.\n\nStep 5: Final evaluation\nWhile customer stickiness through contracts provides short-term stability, the extreme concentration (44.4% from 2 clients) and lack of differentiation in a competitive hyperscale-driven market justify Morningstar's no-moat rating. The low churn rate claims don't sufficiently mitigate the structural risks to long-term cash flow predictability required for a moat designation.",

The previously announced 1.6 million barrels per day cut (or about 600,000-700,000 barrels per day allowing for quota underproduction) by OPEC cut in April has now been extended through the end of 2024 from through the end of 2023.

Brent prices have fallen about 10% since the start of April to about $76 a barrel currently. At the time, we felt, as likely OPEC+ did, that the cuts would be enough to support higher oil prices in the near term with a potential spike to $100 a barrel remaining a possibility in the second half of the year.Thus, the decline in price has likely frustrated the Saudis. Comments from Saudi Arabia ahead of the meeting have been unusually pointed and focused heavily on prices and oil short sellers, indicating in our view, the country is under growing pressure to keep prices high (above $80 a barrel) to ensure enough revenue to fund planned social spending over the next few years. Essentially, the cut and extension threats are widening the gap further in what we already saw as an undersupplied oil market in the second half of 2023 from our April observations.

At a cable rate of 1.40, we estimate comparable costs per pack were $0.70 for Imperial Brands, on around one-third of the volume of PMI, and $0.78 for Altria on volumes of just 14% that of PMI.\n\nPhilip Morris International (PMI) benefits from a wide economic moat due to intangible assets and cost advantages. The company's strong brand loyalty, particularly in premium segments, and economies of scale in procurement and distribution contribute to its competitive edge. Regulatory barriers further solidify its market position.",

Free Fire remains the highest-grossing game in Latin America and Southeast Asia and ranked second globally by average monthly active users for all mobile games on Google Play in the third quarter of 2021. Given the current popularity of Free Fire and the performance and similarity of PUBG, we believe there is some longevity for the franchise in the near term.

This is a continuation of a policy through which India has banned over 200 Chinese apps dating back to early 2020 to punish China over border conflicts.

Using available 2023(E) Total Debt/EBITDA ratios from comparable companies:\n- RTX: 2.4\n- LMT: 1.7\n- BA: 5.1\n- NOC: 11.5\n- GD: 2.8\nSector average = (2.4 + 1.7 + 5.1 + 11.5 + 2.8 + 7.7) / 6 ≈ 5.03\n\nStep 3: Compare TDG’s ratio (7.7) to the sector average (~5.0). TDG’s ratio is 53% higher than the sector average.\n\nStep 4: Interpretation: A higher Total Debt/EBITDA ratio indicates significantly greater leverage than peers. This implies TDG has a heavier debt burden relative to its earnings capacity, increasing refinancing risks and financial vulnerability compared to the sector norm.",
