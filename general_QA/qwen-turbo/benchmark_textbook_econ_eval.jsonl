In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

By the properties established in the preceding paragraphs, we know that Z(p) exhibits homogeneity due to its construction.\\nStep 3: Apply the property of homogeneity to Z(p). For any price vector p and scalar λ > 0, Z(λp) = Z(p) holds true because scaling all prices by λ does not affect the relative differences between prices and demands, which is the essence of the excess demand function.\\nStep 4: Conclude that Z(p) is homogeneous of degree zero in prices, as it satisfies the condition Z(λp) = Z(p) for all λ > 0.\\nThus, the aggregate excess demand function is proven to be homogeneous of degree zero in prices.", "error": null}}

Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.", "Why is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.

(This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)", "Elasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).", "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.", "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$", "Suppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.", "Generally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.", "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.", "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.", "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.", "From Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).", "The exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.", "Two useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.", "In the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.", "For example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).", "In applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.", "If $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.", "Some functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$", "If $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.", "In Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.", "When $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.", "Partial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models.

One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

Fixed costs do not vary with the quantity of output produced, while variable costs change as the firm alters the quantity of output produced.\nAverage total cost is total cost divided by the quantity of output. Marginal cost is the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production. Mathematically, $ATC = TC/Q$ and $MC = \\Delta TC/\\Delta Q$.\n\nThis section explores the relationship between production functions and cost curves, focusing on concepts like fixed costs, variable costs, average total cost, and marginal cost.

Monopoly and monopsony power both cause production to be below the competitive level, so that there is a deadweight loss of consumer and producer surplus.\nWe write the percentage markup of prices over marginal cost as $(P\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C})/P$. For a profit-maximizing monopolist, how does this markup depend on the elasticity of demand?\n\nThis section discusses the concept of market power, its forms (monopoly and monopsony power), and the implications for pricing and social welfare.

Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.", "Why is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.", "If $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)", "Elasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).", "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.", "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$", "Suppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.", "Generally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.", "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.", "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.", "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function.

In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used.

Since the index holds the quantity of inferior goods constant, it fails to capture the potential increase in consumer satisfaction from shifting to higher-quality goods. Thus, the Laspeyres index complicates welfare analysis by not reflecting the true consumer behavior in response to price changes for inferior goods.", "error": null}}

Two ways for obtaining $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\star}$ are:\n● (equation-by-equation OLS) Estimate the two equations separately, thus ignoring the cross-equation restriction, and then use the residuals to calculate $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ Equivalently, estimate the three equations separately by OLS, use the threeequation residuals to calculate $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ (an estimate of the $3\\times3$ error covariance matrix $\\pmb{\\Sigma})$ , and then extract the appropriate submatrix from $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ If $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ is thus obtained, then (as you will verify in the empirical exercise) the numerical invariance is guaranteed; it does not matter which equation to drop.\nObtain $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ from some technique that exploits the cross-equation restriction (such as the pooled OLS applied to the common coefficient format). The numerical invariance in this case is not guaranteed.\nThe numerical invariance holds under equation-by-equation OLS, because the $3\\times3$ matrix $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ , from which $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ is derived, is singular in finite samples. In large samples, as long as $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ is consistent, and even if $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ is not from equation-by-equation OLS, this relationship between $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ and $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ holds asymptotically because $\\pmb{\\Sigma}$ is singular. So the invariance holds asymptotically if $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}^{\\ast}$ is consistent. In particular, the asymptotic variance of parameter estimates does not depend on the choice of equation to drop.\n\nThis section discusses the implications of dropping an equation from a system of equations under cross-equation restrictions, focusing on the numerical invariance of estimates and the role of error covariance matrices.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: The $3\\\\times3$ matrix $\\\\widehat{\\\\pmb{\\\\Sigma}}$ is singular in finite samples under equation-by-equation OLS because it is derived from estimating each equation independently without considering the full system's cross-equation restrictions.\\\\nStep 2: When estimating each equation separately, the residuals lack sufficient information to fully capture the relationships among all equations in the system, leading to a loss of degrees of freedom in the estimated error covariance matrix $\\\\widehat{\\\\pmb{\\\\Sigma}}$.\\\\nStep 3: This singularity arises because the rank of $\\\\widehat{\\\\pmb{\\\\Sigma}}$ is reduced when only part of the system's information is used, making it non-invertible in finite samples.\\\\nStep 4: Despite this singularity, the numerical invariance property holds because the singularity is preserved across different choices of dropped equations, ensuring consistency in the estimation process regardless of which equation is omitted.\"\n}", "model_answer": "Step 1: The $3\\times3$ matrix $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ is singular in finite samples under equation-by-equation OLS because it is derived from estimating each equation independently without considering the full system's cross-equation restrictions.\\nStep 2: When estimating each equation separately, the residuals lack sufficient information to fully capture the relationships among all equations in the system, leading to a loss of degrees of freedom in the estimated error covariance matrix $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$.\\nStep 3: This singularity arises because the rank of $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\Sigma}}$ is reduced when only part of the system's information is used, making it non-invertible in finite samples.\\nStep 4: Despite this singularity, the numerical invariance property holds because the singularity is preserved across different choices of dropped equations, ensuring consistency in the estimation process regardless of which equation is omitted.", "error": null}}

Example: Consider the Cobb-Douglas production $y=z\\_{1}^{a}z\\_{2}^{b}$ : The MRTS is, $$ M R T S=\\frac{f\\_{1}}{f\\_{2}}=\\frac{a z\\_{2}}{b z\\_{1}}. $$ Then, $$ \\frac{d\\left(f\\_{1}(\\mathbf{z})/f\\_{2}(\\mathbf{z})\\right)}{d\\left(z\\_{2}/z\\_{1}\\right)}=\\frac{a}{b}. $$ The elasticity of substitution is, $$ \\sigma\\_{12}=\\frac{b}{a}\\frac{a z\\_{2}/b z\\_{1}}{z\\_{2}/z\\_{1}}=1. $$\n\nThis section covers the properties of production functions, profit maximization for competitive firms, and the derivation of input demand and output supply functions under different returns to scale.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"To prove that the MRTS is equal to the ratio of input prices at the cost-minimizing input combination using the Lagrange method, follow these steps:\\\\nStep 1: Define the cost minimization problem.

This gives f(kx₁, ky₂) = (kx₁)(ky₂).\\\\[br/]Step 3: Simplify the expression. (kx₁)(ky₂) = k²(x₁x₂).\\\\[br/]Step 4: Compare the result with the requirement for constant returns to scale. For constant returns to scale, we need f(kx₁, ky₂) = k × f(x₁, x₂), which simplifies to k²(x₁x₂) = k(x₁x₂).\\\\[br/]Step 5: Analyze the equality. The equality holds true only if k = 1. Therefore, the production function f(x₁, x₂) = x₁x₂ exhibits constant returns to scale when k = 1, meaning it scales proportionally with inputs.", "error": null}}

What are the implications for prediction when variables are omitted from a regression?\nThe result cited is $\\mathrm{E}[{\\bf b}_{1}]={\\bf\\beta}_{1}+{\\bf P}_{1.2}{\\bf\\beta}_{2}$ where ${\\bf P}_{1.2}=({\\bf X}_{1}'{\\bf X}_{1})^{-1}{\\bf X}_{1}'{\\bf X}_{2}$ , so the coefficient estimator is biased. If the conditional mean function $E[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}]$ is a linear function of $\\mathbf{X}_{1}$ , then the sample estimator $\\mathrm{P}_{1.2}$ actually is an unbiased estimator of the slopes of that function. (That result is Theorem B.3, equation (B68), in another form). Now, write the model in the form $$\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{\\beta}_{1}+\\mathrm{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}]\\mathbf{\\beta}_{2}+\\mathbf{\\varepsilon}+(\\mathbf{X}_{2}-\\mathrm{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}])\\mathbf{\\beta}_{2}}\\end{array}$$ So, when we regress $\\mathbf{y}$ on $\\mathbf{X}_{1}$ alone and compute the predictions, we are computing an estimator of ${\\bf X}_{1}({\\bf\\beta}_{1}+{\\bf P}_{1.2}{\\bf\\beta}_{2})={\\bf X}_{1}{\\bf\\beta}_{1}+\\mathrm{E}[{\\bf X}_{2}|{\\bf X}_{1}]{\\bf\\beta}_{2}$ . Both parts of the compound disturbance in this regression $\\varepsilon$ and $(\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathrm{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}])\\beta_{2}$ have mean zero and are uncorrelated with $\\mathbf{X}_{1}$ and $\\operatorname{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}]$ , so the prediction error has mean zero. The implication is that the forecast is unbiased. Note that this is not true if $\\operatorname{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}]$ is nonlinear, since ${\\bf P}_{1.2}$ does not estimate the slopes of the conditional mean in that instance. The generality is that leaving out variables will bias the coefficients, but need not bias the forecasts. It depends on the relationship between the conditional mean function $\\operatorname{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{2}|\\mathbf{X}_{1}]$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{P}_{1,2}$ .\n\nThis section discusses the implications of omitting variables in regression models, focusing on the bias and consistency of estimators and the unbiasedness of forecasts.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT",

The equation compares two options: either cut the current stock $ k $ (yielding immediate value $ k $) or defer cutting and apply the transformation $ h(k) $, discounted by $ \\\\beta $, and then evaluate the future value recursively through $ v(h(k)) $.\\\\nStep 2: Identify the decision rule. The optimal cutting rule depends on comparing the two terms inside the max operator. Specifically, we compare $ k $ (the immediate benefit of cutting) with $ \\\\beta v[h(k)] $ (the discounted future benefit of deferring cutting).\\\\nStep 3: Derive the critical threshold. Let $ k^* $ denote the critical stock level such that cutting is optimal if $ k > k^* $, and deferring cutting is optimal if $ k \\\\leq k^* $. This implies solving the condition $ k^* = \\\\beta v[h(k^*)] $.\\\\nStep 4: Use properties of $ h(k) $. Since $ h(k) $ is strictly increasing and concave, it preserves order and compresses values. This ensures that $ v(k) $ is also concave, which simplifies the analysis of the functional equation.\\\\nStep 5: Conclude the optimal cutting rule.
