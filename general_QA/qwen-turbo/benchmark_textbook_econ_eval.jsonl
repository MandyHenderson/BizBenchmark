By optimality (using a revealed-preference argument) we have that $(\\theta_{\\underline{{\\mathbf{i}}}}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{\\bf~b}_{\\underline{{\\mathbf{i}}}}^{\\prime})\\pi^{\\prime}\\geq(\\theta_{\\underline{{\\mathbf{i}}}}^{\\prime}-\\mathrm{\\bf~b}_{\\underline{{\\mathbf{i}}}}^{\\prime\\prime})\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}$ which implies: $$ \\frac{\\theta_{\\bf i}^{\\prime}-{\\bf b}_{\\bf i}^{\\prime}}{\\theta_{\\bf i}^{\\prime}-{\\bf b}_{\\bf i}^{\\prime\\prime}}\\leq\\frac{\\pi^{\\prime}}{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}}. $$ and similarly, $(\\theta_{\\bf i}^{\\prime\\prime}-\\mathrm{\\bf~b}_{\\bf i}^{\\prime\\prime})\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}\\geq(\\theta_{\\bf i}^{\\prime\\prime}-\\mathrm{\\bf~b}_{\\bf i}^{\\prime})\\pi^{\\prime}$ which implies: $$ \\frac{\\theta_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}-b_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}{\\theta_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}-b_{i}^{\\prime}}\\geq\\frac{\\pi^{\\prime}}{\\pi^{\\prime\\prime}} $$ (i) and (ii) imply (after some simple algebra) that $(\\theta_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\prime\\prime}-\\theta_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\prime})(\\mathbf{b}_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\prime}-\\mathbf{b}_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\prime\\prime})\\geq0$ which is a contradiction to our assumption that $\\theta_{\\frac{1}{4}}^{\\prime}<\\theta_{\\frac{1}{4}}^{\\prime\\prime}$ and $\\mathfrak{b}_{\\frac{1}{4}}^{\\prime}>\\mathfrak{b}_{\\frac{1}{4}}^{\\prime\\prime}$.\n(b) Assume in negation that there is a symmetric equilibrium with $(\\theta^{\\prime},\\theta^{\\prime\\prime})$ such that $b^{x}(\\theta)=\\dot{b}$ for all $\\theta\\in(\\theta^{\\prime},\\theta^{\\prime\\prime})$. Let $\\pi>0$ denote the (strictly positive) probability that all agents' types are in this interval (it must be that in this case all agents get the good with equal probability because the equilibrium is symmetric). Let $p_{1}(\\theta_{1})$ be the probability that agent i gets the good if he bids $b^{x}(\\theta_{1})$. Now assume that for all $\\theta_{i}\\in(\\theta^{\\prime},\\theta^{\\prime\\prime})$ agent 1 deviates and bids $b+\\epsilon>b$. For $\\epsilon$ small, the loss is $p_{1}(\\theta_{1})\\cdot\\epsilon$, while the gain is that he will get the good with probability 1 in the event that all types are in $(\\theta^{\\prime},\\theta^{\\prime\\prime})$, and will increase the probability of getting the good in all other events. Ignoring the second gain, the total change is then at least: $>0$. So for small enough $\\epsilon$ this deviation is beneficial. Therefore, we must have $b^{x}(\\theta_{i})$ strictly increasing.\n(c) We need to verify that the conditions for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem are satisfied. First, all valuations are drawn from an interval with positive density. Second, for the lowest valuation each agent gets the good with probability zero so the expected utility is zero. Finally, since $b^{x}(\\theta_{i})$ is strictly increasing, then the highest valuation agent gets the good with probability one and all others get nothing. These conditions are equivalent to those that would be satisfied for a sealed-bid second-price auction, and therefore the Revenue Equivalence Theorem holds.\n\nThis section proves the monotonicity of bidding strategies in auctions, showing that higher types bid higher amounts, and discusses the implications for the Revenue Equivalence Theorem.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Assume in negation that the bidding strategy $b^{x}(\\\\\\\\[theta]_{i})$ is not strictly increasing in $\\\\\\\\[theta]_{i}$.

We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics. The natural logarithm is denoted as $y = \\log(x)$ and is defined only for $x > 0$.

To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.

It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).", "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.", "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$.

The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.", "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.", "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.", "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.", "From Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).", "The exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.", "Two useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.", "In the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.", "For example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).", "In applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.", "If $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.", "Some functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$", "If $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.", "In Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used.

Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.", "Partial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models.

One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economicsânot just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

Economists have long used lighthouses as examples of a public good. Lighthouses are used to mark specific locations so that passing ships can avoid treacherous waters. The benefit that the lighthouse provides to the ship captain is neither excludable nor rival, so each captain has an incentive to free ride by using the lighthouse to navigate without paying for the service. Because of this free-rider problem, private markets usually fail to provide the lighthouses that ship captains need. As a result, most lighthouses today are operated by the government.", "In some cases, however, lighthouses may be closer to private goods.

For example, a fireworks display is a public good if performed in a town with many residents. Yet if performed at a private amusement park, such as Walt Disney World, a fireworks display is more like a private good because visitors to the park pay for admission.\nAnother example is a lighthouse. Economists have long used lighthouses as examples of a public good. Lighthouses are used to mark specific locations so that passing ships can avoid treacherous waters. The benefit that the lighthouse provides to the ship captain is neither excludable nor rival, so each captain has an incentive to free ride by using the lighthouse to navigate without paying for the service. Because of this free-rider problem, private markets usually fail to provide the lighthouses that ship captains need. As a result, most lighthouses today are operated by the government.\nIn some cases, however, lighthouses may be closer to private goods.

The owner of the local lighthouse did not try to charge ship captains for the service but did charge the owner of the nearby port.

The key difference is that an indicator can be written as $$ q_{1}=\\delta_{0}+\\delta_{1}q+a_{1} $$ where $$ \\begin{array}{r}{\\operatorname{Cov}(q,a_{1})=0,\\qquad\\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbf{x},a_{1})=\\mathbf{0}}\\end{array} $$\nPlugging $q_{1}$ in for $q$ and rearranging gives $$ \\boldsymbol{y}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{0}+\\mathbf{x}\\pmb{\\beta}+\\gamma_{1}\\pmb{q}_{1}+(\\boldsymbol{v}-\\gamma_{1}\\pmb{a}_{1}) $$ where $\\gamma_{1}=\\gamma/\\delta_{1}$ . Now, $q_{2}$ is uncorrelated with $v$ because it is redundant in equation (5.45). Further, by assumption, $q_{2}$ is uncorrelated with $a_{1}$ $[a_{1}$ is uncorrelated with $q$ and $a_{2}$ ). Since $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are correlated, $q_{2}$ can be used as an IV for $q_{1}$ in equation (5.51).\n\nThis section discusses the use of instrumental variables (IV) to address omitted variable bias and measurement error in econometric models. The focus is on models where an unobserved variable q is correlated with the explanatory variables, leading to biased OLS estimates. IV methods are proposed as a solution, leveraging indicators of the unobservable q.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Proxy Variable Approach - This method assumes the existence of a single proxy variable zâ such that q = Î¸â + Î¸âzâ + râ.

In the context of unit root tests like the DF test, the size can vary depending on how the test is conducted. For instance, the DF test is sensitive to assumptions about the error terms being independently and identically distributed. If these assumptions are violated, the nominal size may differ from the true size, leading to incorrect rejection rates.\\\\nStep 2: Power of a Test - The power of a test is its ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis. In the case of unit root tests, most DF-type tests have low power, meaning they often fail to detect a stationary process when one exists. This implies that these tests may incorrectly conclude the presence of a unit root even when the time series is actually stationary.\\\\nStep 3: Trade-offs - There is a trade-off between the size and power of a test. A test with a very small size (low nominal significance level) may have low power, making it less likely to detect true effects.

In the context of unit root tests like the DF test, the size can vary depending on how the test is conducted. For instance, the DF test is sensitive to assumptions about the error terms being independently and identically distributed. If these assumptions are violated, the nominal size may differ from the true size, leading to incorrect rejection rates.\\nStep 2: Power of a Test - The power of a test is its ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis. In the case of unit root tests, most DF-type tests have low power, meaning they often fail to detect a stationary process when one exists. This implies that these tests may incorrectly conclude the presence of a unit root even when the time series is actually stationary.\\nStep 3: Trade-offs - There is a trade-off between the size and power of a test. A test with a very small size (low nominal significance level) may have low power, making it less likely to detect true effects. Conversely, increasing the power of the test might lead to a higher size, increasing the risk of Type I errors (rejecting a true null hypothesis).

For Player 1, equate 2q - 1 = 1 - 2q, which simplifies to q = 0.5. For Player 2, equate 1 - 2p = 2p - 1, which also simplifies to p = 0.5.\\nStep 5: Verify that these probabilities constitute a Nash equilibrium. At p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their strategy because their expected payoffs are equal regardless of their choice.\\nStep 6: Compute the expected payoff for each player at the Nash equilibrium. Substituting p = 0.5 and q = 0.5 into either player's expected payoff equation yields an expected payoff of 0 for both players.", "error": null}}

If $\\sigma_{X Y}<0$ , then, on average, when $X$ is above its mean, $Y$ is below its mean.\nSeveral expressions useful for computing $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)$ are as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu_{X})(Y-\\mu_{Y})]=\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu_{X})Y]} &{=\\operatorname{E}[X(Y-\\mu_{Y})]=\\operatorname{E}(X Y)-\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}.}\\end{array} $$\nIf $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=0$ . This property follows from equation (B.27) and the fact that $\\operatorname{E}(X Y)=\\operatorname{E}(X)\\operatorname{E}(Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are independent. It is important to remember that the converse of COV.1 is not true: zero covariance between $X$ and $Y$ does not imply that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.\nFor any constants $a_{1},b_{1},a_{2}$ , and $b_{2}$ , $$ \\mathrm{Cov}(a_{1}X+b_{1},a_{2}Y+b_{2})=a_{1}a_{2}\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y). $$\nThe correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is defined as: $$ \\operatorname{Corr}(X,Y)\\equiv{\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\operatorname{sd}(X)\\cdot\\operatorname{sd}(Y)}}={\\frac{\\sigma_{X Y}}{\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{Y}}}; $$ the correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is sometimes denoted $\\rho_{X Y}$ (and is sometimes called the population correlation).\nIf $\\mathbf{Corr}(X,Y)=0$ , or equivalently $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=0$ , then there is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$ , and $X$ and $Y$ are said to be uncorrelated; otherwise, $X$ and $Y$ are correlated. $\\operatorname{Corr}(X,Y)=1$ implies a perfect positive linear relationship, which means that we can write $Y=a+b X$ , for some constant $a$ and some constant $b>0$ . $\\mathbf{Corr}(X,Y)= -1$ implies a perfect negative relationship, so that $Y=a+b X$ , for some $b<0$ .\n\nThis section covers the median as a measure of central tendency and introduces variance and standard deviation as measures of variability.

Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

The equation compares two options: either cut the current stock $ k $ (yielding immediate value $ k $) or defer cutting and apply the transformation $ h(k) $, discounted by $ \\\\beta $, and then evaluate the future value recursively through $ v(h(k)) $.\\\\nStep 2: Identify the decision rule. The optimal cutting rule depends on comparing the two terms inside the max operator. Specifically, we compare $ k $ (the immediate benefit of cutting) with $ \\\\beta v[h(k)] $ (the discounted future benefit of deferring cutting).\\\\nStep 3: Derive the critical threshold. Let $ k^* $ denote the critical stock level such that cutting is optimal if $ k > k^* $, and deferring cutting is optimal if $ k \\\\leq k^* $. This implies solving the condition $ k^* = \\\\beta v[h(k^*)] $.\\\\nStep 4: Use properties of $ h(k) $. Since $ h(k) $ is strictly increasing and concave, it preserves order and compresses values. This ensures that $ v(k) $ is also concave, which simplifies the analysis of the functional equation.\\\\nStep 5: Conclude the optimal cutting rule.
