Consumers bought the camera and film to take instant pictures: The camera was the 'entry fee' that provided access to the consumption of instant pictures, which was what consumers ultimately demanded.\nPolaroid's profit is given by $$\\pi=P Q+n T-C_{1}(Q)-C_{2}(n)$$ where $P$ is the price of the film, $T$ is the price of the camera, $Q$ is the quantity of film sold, $n$ is the number of cameras sold, and $C_{1}(Q)$ and $C_{2}(n)$ are the costs of producing film and cameras, respectively.\nBundling makes sense when customers have heterogeneous demands, and when the firm cannot price discriminate. With films, different movie theaters serve different groups of patrons and therefore may well have different demands for films.\nIn general, the effectiveness of bundling depends on how negatively correlated demands are. In other words, it works best when consumers who have a high reservation price for good 1 have a low reservation price for good 2, and vice versa.\n\nThis section explores the application of two-part tariffs and bundling as pricing strategies in monopolistic markets, using Polaroid cameras and film, and movie theater film leases as examples. It discusses the conditions under which these strategies maximize profits and how market entry by competitors affects pricing decisions.",

(2) The idea of globalization and the increasing returns to scale in international trade, which can make carrying trade more efficient and beneficial for economic growth. (3) The concept of trade creation and trade diversion, which suggests that free trade agreements and carrying trade can lead to the creation of new trade opportunities and the diversion of trade from less efficient to more efficient producers. (4) The concept of the 'new trade theory', which emphasizes the importance of economies of scale, product differentiation, and intra-industry trade in international trade. This theory suggests that carrying trade can be beneficial for economic growth and development by allowing countries to specialize in specific industries and products.",

Then the solution of the Kalman filtering problem defined by $\\{A_{t_{1}-1-t}^{\\prime}$, $C_{t_{1}-1-t}^{\\prime}$, $G_{t_{1}-1-t}V_{1t_{1}-1-t}G_{t_{1}-1-t}^{\\prime},V_{2t_{1}-1-t},G_{t_{1}-1-t}V_{3t_{1}-1-t}$ t; $t=$ ${{t}_{0}},\\ldots,{{t}_{1}}-1;\\Sigma_{{{t}_{0}}}\\}$ is given by $\\{K_{t_{1}-t-1}^{\\prime}=F_{t},\\Sigma_{t_{1}-t}=P_{t}$ ; $t=t_{0}$, $t_{0}+1,\\ldots,t_{1}-$ $1\\}$.\n\nThis section explores the duality between the Kalman filtering problem and the optimal linear regulator problem, highlighting the mathematical symmetry in their formulations and solutions.",

As a result, resources (land, labor, and capital) would be diverted away from more productive uses, such as corn or pasture, to meet the increased demand for wine. This would lead to a misallocation of resources, as the ban would prevent the most valuable uses of these resources from being realized. In other words, the ban would create a market distortion, causing resources to be allocated based on the artificial scarcity created by the ban rather than their natural value.

According to Smith, if the quantity of land that can be fitted for a particular produce, such as wine, is too small to supply the effectual demand, the whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing to give somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent, wages, and profit necessary for raising and bringing it to market. This means that the ban on new vineyards would likely lead to a shortage of wine, causing its price to rise above its natural price. As a result, resources (land, labor, and capital) would be diverted away from more productive uses, such as corn or pasture, to meet the increased demand for wine. This would lead to a misallocation of resources, as the ban would prevent the most valuable uses of these resources from being realized. In other words, the ban would create a market distortion, causing resources to be allocated based on the artificial scarcity created by the ban rather than their natural value. This would likely lead to a decrease in overall economic welfare, as resources are not being used in their most valuable and productive ways.",

Two standard deviation properties immediately follow from Properties VAR.1 and VAR.2: For any constant $c$ , $\\operatorname{sd}(c)=0$ . For any constants $a$ and $b$ , $$ {\\mathrm{sd}}(a X+b)=|a|{\\mathrm{sd}}(X). $$\nAs an application of the properties of variance and standard deviation, suppose that given a random variable $X$ , we define a new random variable by subtracting off its mean $\\mu$ and dividing by its standard deviation $\\sigma$ : $$ Z\\equiv\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}, $$ which we can write as $Z=a X+b$ , where $a\\equiv(1/\\sigma)$ , and $b\\equiv-(\\mu/\\sigma)$ . Then, from Property E.2, $$ \\operatorname{E}(Z)=a\\operatorname{E}(X)+b=(\\mu/\\sigma)-(\\mu/\\sigma)=0. $$ From Property VAR.2, $$ \\operatorname{Var}(Z)=a^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(X)=(\\sigma^{2}/\\sigma^{2})=1. $$\nThe covariance between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ , sometimes called the population covariance to emphasize that it concerns the relationship between two variables describing a population, is defined as the expected value of the product $(X-\\mu_{X})(Y-\\mu_{Y})$ : $$ \\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)\\equiv\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu_{X})(Y-\\mu_{Y})], $$ which is sometimes denoted $\\sigma_{X Y}$ . If $\\sigma_{X Y}>0$ , then, on average, when $X$ is above its mean, $Y$ is also above its mean. If $\\sigma_{X Y}<0$ , then, on average, when $X$ is above its mean, $Y$ is below its mean.\nSeveral expressions useful for computing $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)$ are as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu_{X})(Y-\\mu_{Y})]=\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu_{X})Y]} &{=\\operatorname{E}[X(Y-\\mu_{Y})]=\\operatorname{E}(X Y)-\\mu_{X}\\mu_{Y}.}\\end{array} $$\nIf $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=0$ . This property follows from equation (B.27) and the fact that $\\operatorname{E}(X Y)=\\operatorname{E}(X)\\operatorname{E}(Y)$ when $X$ and $Y$ are independent. It is important to remember that the converse of COV.1 is not true: zero covariance between $X$ and $Y$ does not imply that $X$ and $Y$ are independent.\nFor any constants $a_{1},b_{1},a_{2}$ , and $b_{2}$ , $$ \\mathrm{Cov}(a_{1}X+b_{1},a_{2}Y+b_{2})=a_{1}a_{2}\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y). $$\nThe correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is defined as: $$ \\operatorname{Corr}(X,Y)\\equiv{\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\operatorname{sd}(X)\\cdot\\operatorname{sd}(Y)}}={\\frac{\\sigma_{X Y}}{\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{Y}}}; $$ the correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is sometimes denoted $\\rho_{X Y}$ (and is sometimes called the population correlation).\nIf $\\mathbf{Corr}(X,Y)=0$ , or equivalently $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)=0$ , then there is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$ , and $X$ and $Y$ are said to be uncorrelated; otherwise, $X$ and $Y$ are correlated. $\\operatorname{Corr}(X,Y)=1$ implies a perfect positive linear relationship, which means that we can write $Y=a+b X$ , for some constant $a$ and some constant $b>0$ . $\\mathbf{Corr}(X,Y)= -1$ implies a perfect negative relationship, so that $Y=a+b X$ , for some $b<0$ .\n\nThis section covers the median as a measure of central tendency and introduces variance and standard deviation as measures of variability. It also discusses the properties of these measures and their applications in standardizing random variables.",

Consider two random variables X and Y such that X = 1 with probability 0.5 and X = -1 with probability 0.5, and Y = X + 1. In this case, Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))] = E[(X - 0)(X + 1 - 1)] = E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = 0.5(1^2 + (-1)^2) - 0^2 = 1 - 0 = 1, but X and Y are not independent because Y is a function of X.\nStep 3: Explain why zero covariance does not imply independence.

If the data are not detrended, the autoregressive correlation tends to be overestimated, which biases toward finding a unit root in a trending process.\nIn the AR(1) model (11.12), we showed that, under assumption (11.13), the errors $\\left\\{u\\_t\\right\\}$ must be serially uncorrelated in the sense that Assumption $\\mathrm{TS}.5^{\\prime}$ is satisfied: assuming that no serial correlation exists is practically the same thing as assuming that only one lag of $y$ appears in $\\mathrm{E}(y\\_t|y\\_{t-1},y\\_{t-2},...)$ .\nIn the general model $y\\_t=\\beta\\_0+\\beta\\_1x\\_{t1}+...+\\beta\\_kx\\_{t k}+u\\_t,$ where the explanatory variables $\\pmb{x}\\_t=(x\\_{t1},...,x\\_{t k})$ may or may not contain lags of $y$ or $z$ , (11.31) becomes $\\mathrm{E}(u\\_t|x\\_t,y\\_{t-1},\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\_{t-1},\\dots)=0.$\n\nThis section discusses the implications of dynamically complete models and the absence of serial correlation in time series analysis. It covers the estimation of models with unit roots, the use of first differences, and the conditions under which errors are serially uncorrelated.",

A figurine can be manufactured by $F=3P+2C$ where $P$ are pounds of plastic, and $C$ are pounds of clay. Plastic costs $\\$4$ per pound and clay costs $\\$3$ per pound. What would be the lowest cost of producing 10,000 figurines?\nRocco's Pasta Bar makes manicotti according to an old family recipe where $M=min(5/4*C,5P)$ $M,C$; and $P$ are pounds of manicotti, cheese, and pasta respectively. If cheese costs $\\$2$ per pound, and pasta costs $\\$5$ per pound, how much would it cost to produce 30 pounds of manicotti in the cheapest way possible?\n\nThis section explores cost minimization problems and production functions in economics, focusing on how firms optimize production given budget constraints and input costs.",

      "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"To find the cost-minimizing combination of plastic ($P$) and clay ($C$) to produce 10,000 figurines, we need to minimize the total cost function, which is given by the production function $F=3P+2C$. The total cost is the sum of the cost of plastic and the cost of clay. The cost of plastic is $4P$ and the cost of clay is $3C$. Therefore, the total cost function is $TC = 4P + 3C$. We are given that the production level is 10,000 figurines, so we can substitute $F = 10,000$ into the production function to get $10,000 = 3P + 2C$. We can now solve for $P$ in terms of $C$: $P = \\frac{10,000 - 2C}{3}$. The total cost function can now be written as $TC = 4(\\frac{10,000 - 2C}{3}) + 3C$. Simplifying this expression, we get $TC = \\frac{40,000 - 8C}{3} + 3C = \\frac{40,000 - 5C}{3}$. To minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of $C$ that minimizes this expression. Taking the derivative of $TC$ with respect to $C$, we get $\\frac{d(TC)}{dC} = -\\frac{5}{3}$. Setting this equal to zero, we get $-\\frac{5}{3} = 0$, which is not possible. However, we can see that the derivative is always negative, which means that the total cost function is decreasing as $C$ increases. Therefore, the minimum value of $TC$ occurs when $C$ is as large as possible. Since $C$ cannot be negative, the minimum value of $TC$ occurs when $C = 0$. Substituting $C = 0$ into the production function, we get $P = \\frac{10,000}{3} = 3,333.33$.

      "model_raw_response": "{\n\"Step 1: The joint test statistic $\\tau_{3,4}$ for skewness and excess kurtosis has several advantages compared to separate tests. Firstly, it allows for the simultaneous testing of both skewness and excess kurtosis, which can provide a more comprehensive assessment of the normality of the error terms. Secondly, the asymptotic independence of $\\tau_{3}$ and $\\tau_{4}$ under the null hypothesis facilitates the use of the joint test statistic, as the joint distribution of the two statistics can be approximated by a $\\chi^{2}(2)$ distribution. This is because the joint distribution of two independent standard normal variables is a $\\chi^{2}(2)$ distribution. \nStep 2: The joint test statistic $\\tau_{3,4}$ also has some limitations. One limitation is that it requires the estimation of the variance $\\sigma^{2}$, which can be sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. Another limitation is that the joint test statistic may not be as powerful as separate tests for skewness and excess kurtosis, especially when the error terms are not normally distributed. \nStep 3: The asymptotic independence of $\\tau_{3}$ and $\\tau_{4}$ under the null hypothesis is a key property that facilitates the use of the joint test statistic. This property is based on the fact that the residuals $e_{t}$ are asymptotically independent and identically distributed under the null hypothesis, and that the test statistics $\\tau_{3}$ and $\\tau_{4}$ are functions of the residuals. As a result, the joint distribution of $\\tau_{3}$ and $\\tau_{4}$ can be approximated by a $\\chi^{2}(2)$ distribution, which allows for the use of the joint test statistic $\\tau_{3,4}$. \nStep 4: In conclusion, the joint test statistic $\\tau_{3,4}$ has several advantages and limitations compared to separate tests for skewness and excess kurtosis. The asymptotic independence of $\\tau_{3}$ and $\\tau_{4}$ under the null hypothesis facilitates the use of the joint test statistic, but the estimation of the variance $\\sigma^{2}$ and the potential lack of power of the joint test statistic are limitations that should be considered.\"",

Thus, belonging to a union appears to be positively related to time-constant, unobserved factors that affect wage.\n\nThis section discusses the implications of using pooled OLS versus fixed effects models when analyzing the relationship between union membership and wages, considering unobserved individual effects.",

      "model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"To calculate the additional profit a firm gains from perfect first-degree price discrimination compared to charging a single price, we need to consider the concept of consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a product and the actual price paid. When a firm charges a single price, it captures only a portion of the consumer surplus, whereas perfect first-degree price discrimination allows the firm to capture the entire consumer surplus by charging each customer their reservation price. Let's denote the demand function as Q = a - bP, where Q is the quantity demanded, a is the intercept, b is the slope, and P is the price. The marginal revenue function is the derivative of the total revenue function, which is given by MR = a - 2bP. The marginal cost function is given by MC = c, where c is a constant. To maximize profit, the firm sets MR = MC. In the case of perfect first-degree price discrimination, the firm charges each customer their reservation price, which is equal to the demand function. Therefore, the additional profit gained from perfect first-degree price discrimination is the difference between the total revenue under perfect price discrimination and the total revenue under a single price. The total revenue under perfect price discrimination is given by TR = ∫[a - bP]dP from P = 0 to P = a, which evaluates to TR = a^2 / (2b). The total revenue under a single price is given by TR = (a - bP)P, which evaluates to TR = a^2 / (2b) - abP / 2. The additional profit gained from perfect first-degree price discrimination is therefore a^2 / (2b) - (a^2 / (2b) - abP / 2) = abP / 2. To find the additional profit in terms of the slope of the demand function, we need to find the value of P that maximizes the additional profit. Since the additional profit is given by abP / 2, we can see that it is maximized when P is maximized. The demand function is given by Q = a - bP, and we know that Q = 0 when P = a / b. Therefore, the maximum value of P is a / b. Substituting this value into the expression for the additional profit, we get ab(a / b) / 2 = a^2 / (2b).

The MRS is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while remaining on the same indifference curve. Mathematically, it can be represented as MRS = -Δx/Δy, where Δx is the change in the quantity of good x and Δy is the change in the quantity of good y. The MRS is related to the slope of the indifference curve, which is the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute one good for another. The slope of the indifference curve is equal to the negative of the MRS, i.e., slope = -MRS. This means that as the MRS increases, the slope of the indifference curve decreases, indicating that the consumer is willing to substitute more of good y for good x.",

This suggests that the residuals are likely to be stationary, which is a requirement for the unit root hypothesis to be rejected. However, without the ADF test statistic, we cannot provide a definitive answer.

      "Several things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.",

      "Some useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$",

You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.",
      "If we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.",
      "Why should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.",
      "First, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.",
      "Why is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.",
      "If $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)",
      "Elasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).",
      "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.",
      "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.",
      "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$",
      "Suppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.",
      "Generally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.",
      "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.",
      "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.",
      "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.",
      "From Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).",
      "The exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.",
      "Two useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.",
      "In the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.",
      "For example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).",
      "In applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.",
      "If $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.",
      "Some functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$",
      "If $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.",
      "In Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.",
      "When $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.",
      "Partial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.",
      "A more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$."

Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics. The natural logarithm is denoted as $y = \\log(x)$ and is defined only for $x > 0$. It is a nonlinear function with diminishing marginal returns and is widely used in econometric analysis for approximating proportionate changes and modeling constant elasticity relationships.",

Thus, the OLS estimates from the simple regression equation $w a g e=\\beta\\_{0}+\\beta\\_{1}e d u c+\\nu$ are on average too large.\nAssumption MLR.5 (Homoskedasticity) $\\mathsf{V a r}({\\boldsymbol{u}}|{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\_{1},...,{\\boldsymbol{x}}\\_{k})=\\sigma^{2}$ . Assumption MLR.5 means that the variance in the error term, $u$ , conditional on the explanatory variables, is the same for all combinations of outcomes of the explanatory variables.\nThe variance of the OLS estimator is given by: $$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}\\_{j})=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{\\mathrm{SST}\\_{j}(1-R\\_{j}^{2})},$$ for $j=1,2,...,k,$ where ${\\sf S S T}\\_{j}=\\sum\\_{i=1}^{n}{({X}\\_{i j}-\\bar{X}\\_{j})^{2}}$ is the total sample variation in $X\\_{j},$ and $R\\_{j}^{2}$ is the $R$ -squared from regressing $X\\_{j}$ on all other independent variables (and including an intercept).\n\nThis section discusses omitted variable bias in the context of multiple regression models and the variance of OLS estimators under the Gauss-Markov assumptions.",

Thus, hypotheses such as $$\\begin{array}{r}{H_{0}\\colon\\beta_{2}=\\beta_{3}}\\\\{\\qquad}\\\\{H_{0}\\colon\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}+\\beta_{5}=3}\\end{array}$$ which involve some linear restrictions on the parameters of the $k$ -variable model, or hypotheses such as $$H_{0}\\colon\\beta_{3}=\\beta_{4}=\\beta_{5}=\\beta_{6}=0$$ which imply that some regressors are absent from the model, can all be tested by the $F$ test of (8.7.10).\nThe Chow test assumes that: 1. $u_{1t}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^{2})$ and $u_{2t}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^{2})$ . That is, the error terms in the subperiod regressions are normally distributed with the same (homoscedastic) variance $\\sigma^{2}$ . 2. The two error terms ${\\pmb u}_{1t}$ and ${\\pmb u}_{2t}$ are independently distributed.\nThe mechanics of the Chow test are as follows: 1. Estimate regression (8.8.3), which is appropriate if there is no parameter instability, and obtain ${\\bf R}S S_{3}$ with $\\mathrm d\\mathrm f=(n_{1}+n_{2}-k)$ , where $k$ is the number of parameters estimated, 2 in the present case. For our example $\\mathrm{RSS}_{3}=23,248.30$ . We call ${\\bf R}S S_{3}$ the restricted residual sum of squares $\\mathbf{(RSS_{R})}$ because it is obtained by imposing the restrictions that $\\lambda_{1}=\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}=\\gamma_{2}$ , that is, the subperiod regressions are not different. 2. Estimate (8.8.1) and obtain its residual sum of squares, ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{1}$ , with $\\mathrm{df}=(n_{1}-k)$ . In our example, $\\mathrm{RSS}_{1}=1785.032$ and $\\mathrm{df}=10$ . 3. Estimate (8.8.2) and obtain its residual sum of squares, ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{2}$ , with $\\mathrm{df}=(n_{2}-k)$ . In our example, $\\mathrm{RSS}_{2}=10,005.22$ with $\\mathrm{df}=12$ . 4. Since the two sets of samples are deemed independent, we can add ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{1}$ and ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{2}$ to obtain what may be called the unrestricted residual sum of squares $(\\mathbf{RSS_{UR}})$ , that is, obtain: $$\\operatorname{RSS}_{\\operatorname{UR}}=\\operatorname{RSS}_{1}+\\operatorname{RSS}_{2}\\qquad{\\mathrm{with~df}}=(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)$$ In the present case, $$\\mathrm{RSS}_{\\mathrm{UR}}=(1785.032+10,005.22)=11,790.252$$ 5. Now the idea behind the Chow test is that if in fact there is no structural change [i.e., regressions (8.8.1) and (8.8.2) are essentially the same], then the ${\\bf R}S S_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and ${\\tt R S S}_{\\mathrm{UR}}$ should not be statistically different. Therefore, if we form the following ratio: $$F=\\frac{(\\mathrm{RSS_{R}}-\\mathrm{RSS_{UR}})/k}{(\\mathrm{RSS_{UR}})/(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)}\\sim F_{[k,(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)]}$$\n\nThis section discusses the application of the $F$ test for hypotheses about regression parameters and introduces the Chow test for detecting structural changes in regression models. The Chow test is particularly useful for assessing whether the relationship between the dependent and independent variables remains stable across different time periods or groups.",

This allows researchers to use these variables to identify the structural parameters of the model, such as the coefficients of the labor supply and demand equations.\n\nStep 3: In the labor supply equation, z1 (average manufacturing wage in the county) is an observed variable that affects labor supply, while u1 contains other factors that affect labor supply. Similarly, in the labor demand equation, z2 (agricultural land area) is an observable demand shifter, while u2 is an unobservable demand shifter.\n\nStep 4: The equilibrium condition (hs = hd) allows researchers to combine the labor supply and demand equations, resulting in a single equation with multiple endogenous variables (hs and wi). This equation can be used to identify the structural parameters of the model, but only if the exogenous variables (z1 and z2) are included.\n\nStep 5: The inclusion of exogenous variables like z1 and z2 is essential for identification because they provide a way to distinguish between the effects of the independent variables and the error terms. Without these variables, the model would be underidentified, and the structural parameters could not be estimated.\n}",

    "merged_original_paper_extracted_texts": [
      "The nonlinear function that plays the most important role in econometric analysis is the natural logarithm. In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$",
      "The function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.",
      "Several things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.",
      "The following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$",
      "Some useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$",
      "The logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.",
      "If we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.",
      "Why should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.",
      "First, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.",
      "Why is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.",
      "If $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)",
      "Elasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).",
      "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.",
      "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.",
      "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$",
      "Suppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.",
      "Generally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.",
      "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.",
      "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour.

    "question_context": "The nonlinear function that plays the most important role in econometric analysis is the natural logarithm. In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point.

This variance depends on the value of p(x), which is a function of the explanatory variables x. Since p(x) is a linear function of the parameters β_j, it can take on any value between 0 and 1.

      "model_raw_response": "{\n    \"The footloose entrepreneur model, as discussed in the context, does not explicitly derive the conditions for overagglomeration or underagglomeration. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the model likely considers the effects of factor endowments, trade costs, and pecuniary externalities on agglomeration. The conditions for overagglomeration or underagglomeration may be related to the threshold effects, discontinuities, and hysteresis mentioned in the five-item list of new effects provided by Baldwin et al. These effects can lead to non-linear outcomes, where small changes in initial conditions can result in significant differences in agglomeration outcomes. The welfare implications for immobile factors would depend on the specific conditions of the model and the type of immobile factor in question. In general, overagglomeration may lead to increased competition and downward pressure on wages for immobile factors, while underagglomeration may result in reduced access to markets and higher costs for immobile factors.

If faminc $= faminc^* + e_1$ and the CEV assumptions hold, then using reported family income in place of actual family income will bias the OLS estimator of $\\beta_1$ towards zero.\nConsider a variant on Example 9.7: $$colGPA = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 smoked^* + \\beta_2 hsGPA + \\beta_3 SAT + u,$$ where smoked* is the actual number of times a student smoked marijuana in the last 30 days. The variable smoked is the answer to the question: On how many separate occasions did you smoke marijuana in the last 30 days? Suppose we postulate the standard measurement error model $$smoked = smoked^* + e_1.$$ Even if we assume that students try to report the truth, the CEV assumption is unlikely to hold. People who do not smoke marijuana at all—so that smoked* $= 0$—are likely to report smoked $= 0$, so the measurement error is probably zero for students who never smoke marijuana. When smoked* $> 0$, it is much more likely that the student miscounts how many times he or she smoked marijuana in the last 30 days. This means that the measurement error $e_1$ and the actual number of times smoked, smoked*, are correlated, which violates the CEV assumption.\n\nThis section discusses the implications of measurement error in explanatory variables on the OLS estimator, focusing on the Classical Errors-in-Variables (CEV) model and violations of its assumptions.",

Endogenous variables are those that are determined within the model itself, such as the labor force participation rate, the number of job openings, and the wage rate.

Exogenous variables, on the other hand, are external factors that affect the model, such as government policies, technological changes, and demographic shifts.

Because people neglect this negative externality when deciding how many sheep to own, the result is an excessive number of sheep.\nThe government can solve the problem by reducing use of the common resource through regulation or taxes. Alternatively, the government can sometimes turn the common resource into a private good.\n\nThis section examines the Tragedy of the Commons, a parable illustrating the overuse of common resources due to negative externalities. It discusses solutions to mitigate this problem.",

Supply: Q = 14 + 2(2) + 0.25(8) = 14 + 4 + 2 = 20 Tcf Demand: Q = -5(2) + 3.75(8) = -10 + 30 = 20 Tcf Since Q* = 20 Tcf, we can find the equilibrium price P* using either the supply or demand equation. Using the supply equation: 20 = 14 + 2P_G + 0.25P_O Substituting P_O = $8.00: 20 = 14 + 2P_G + 2 P_G = 6 / 2 = $3.00 However, we are given that the equilibrium price is $2.00, which means our initial assumption of P_O = $8.00 is incorrect. We need to find the correct value of P_O that gives an equilibrium price of $2.00.

Specifically, the omitted variable bias arises because the coefficient on x1 is inflated by the effect of the omitted variable, resulting in an upward bias in the estimate of $\beta_{1}$. This is because the law of iterated projections implies that $\beta_{1} = \frac{\beta_{1} + \beta_{2}\beta_{3}}{1 - \beta_{2}\beta_{4}}$, where $\beta_{3}$ and $\beta_{4}$ are the coefficients on risktol and the interaction term between risktol and x1, respectively. When risktol is omitted, the interaction term is also omitted, leading to an inconsistent estimate of $\beta_{1}$. Therefore, the inconsistency (asymptotic bias) of $\tilde{\beta}_{1}$ arises because the omitted variable (risktol) is positively related to the dependent variable (y) and its effect is captured by the coefficient on x1.",

Feeding countries are highly improved and benefit from lower prices of lean cattle.\n2.  **Transport Costs**: Importing cattle involves significant transport costs, making it feasible only for lean cattle, which can be driven long distances. Fat cattle cannot be transported as easily.\n3.  **Market Impact**: Lean cattle imports reduce the price of lean cattle, benefiting feeding countries (lower input costs) but harming breeding countries (lower revenue).\n4.  **Empirical Evidence**: The small number of Irish cattle imported and the sustained high price of lean cattle support Smith's argument.",

Potential issues with using mother's education as an instrument include: (1) omitted variable bias: if mother's education is correlated with other unobserved factors that affect education, the instrument may be invalid; (2) weak instrument problem: if mother's education has a weak effect on education, the instrument may not be effective in identifying the causal effect of education on the outcome variable; (3) endogeneity of the instrument: if mother's education is itself endogenous, it may be correlated with the error term, leading to inconsistent estimates.",

Step 3: We can solve this system of equations to find the values of z1 and z2 that maximize the Lagrangian function. We find that z1 = p1/λ∂f/∂z1 and z2 = p2/λ∂f/∂z2. Step 4: Now, we can substitute these expressions for z1 and z2 into the MRTS formula to get MRTS = (∂f/∂z1)/(∂f/∂z2) = p2/λ∂f/∂z2 / p1/λ∂f/∂z1 = p2/p1. Therefore, we have shown that the MRTS is equal to the ratio of input prices at the cost-minimizing input combination.",

This mutual interest disposed them to support the king, who in turn supported them against the lords.

The feudal system, where the occupiers of land in the country were exposed to every sort of violence, created a hostile environment for labor migrants.

The joint distribution is given by the product of the conditional distribution of y1 given y2 and Z, and the marginal distribution of y2 given Z. This is expressed as f(y1, y2 | Z) = f(y1 | y2, Z) f(y2 | Z).\n\nStep 2: Express the conditional distribution of y1 given y2 and Z. Since y1 is a Tobit variable, its conditional distribution is given by the cdf of the normal distribution, truncated at zero. This can be expressed as f(y1 | y2, Z) = Φ((y1 - Zδ1 - α1y2) / τ1) / (1 - Φ(-Zδ1 - α1y2 / τ1)), where Φ is the cdf of the standard normal distribution.\n\nStep 3: Express the marginal distribution of y2 given Z. Since y2 is a linear regression model, its marginal distribution is given by the normal distribution. This can be expressed as f(y2 | Z) = φ(y2 - Zδ2) / τ2, where φ is the pdf of the standard normal distribution.\n\nStep 4: Combine the expressions for the conditional and marginal distributions to obtain the joint distribution of (y1, y2) given Z. This is given by f(y1, y2 | Z) = f(y1 | y2, Z) f(y2 | Z) = Φ((y1 - Zδ1 - α1y2) / τ1) / (1 - Φ(-Zδ1 - α1y2 / τ1)) φ(y2 - Zδ2) / τ2.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression for the joint distribution. This can be done by combining the terms and rearranging the expression. The resulting expression is a product of two normal distributions, one for y1 and one for y2, with a non-normal distribution for the joint variable (y1, y2).\n\nStep 6: Derive the log-likelihood function for the full maximum likelihood estimation of the Tobit model with endogenous explanatory variables. The log-likelihood function is given by the logarithm of the joint distribution of (y1, y2) given Z. This can be expressed as l(β) = ∑[log(f(y1i, y2i | Zi))], where the sum is taken over all observations i. Substituting the expression for the joint distribution, we get l(β) = ∑[log(Φ((y1i - Ziδ1 - α1y2i) / τ1) / (1 - Φ(-Ziδ1 - α1y2i / τ1))) + log(φ(y2i - Ziδ2) / τ2)].\n}",

The $(k_{1}+1)$th column of $\\gamma_{i}$ in Equation (3.6) is invariant to the choice of $A_{0}\\in\\mathcal{Q}_{V}\\cap\\mathcal{Q}_{\\tau}$.\n\nThis section discusses the identification of monetary policy shocks using the recursiveness assumption, which posits that these shocks are orthogonal to the monetary authority's information set. The assumption justifies a two-step estimation procedure and is mapped into a VAR framework for computational efficiency and robustness.",

Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes of some workers, but they also cause other workers to be unemployed.\nHelping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling prices. For instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying a fraction of the rent for poor families. Unlike rent control, such rent subsidies do not reduce the quantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not lead to housing shortages. Similarly, wage subsidies raise the living standards of the working poor without discouraging firms from hiring them. An example of a wage subsidy is the earned income tax credit, a government program that supplements the incomes of low-wage workers.\n\nThis section discusses the economic implications of price controls such as price ceilings and price floors, and how they affect market outcomes. It also explores alternative policies like subsidies and their effects on market efficiency.",

      "Several things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.",

      "Why should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.",

However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.",
      "Why is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.

      "Elasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).",
      "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.",
      "For our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.",
      "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$.

      "Generally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.",
      "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.",
      "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week.

If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.",
      "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.",
      "From Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).",
      "The exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.",
      "Two useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.",
      "In the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.",
      "For example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).",
      "In applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.",
      "If $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.",
      "Some functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$",
      "If $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.",
      "In Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.",
      "When $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.",
      "Partial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.",
      "A more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$."

This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics. The natural logarithm is denoted as $y = \\log(x)$ and is defined only for $x > 0$. It is a nonlinear function with diminishing marginal returns and is widely used in econometric analysis for approximating proportionate changes and modeling constant elasticity relationships.",

The boundedness assumption on sequences in M is crucial for the existence of V(·) because it ensures that the sequences are well-behaved and can be handled by the aggregator function G and the one-period utility function u. Specifically, the boundedness assumption implies that the sequences in M are non-decreasing and have a finite limit, which is necessary for the existence of V(·).

The boundedness assumption on sequences in M is significant because it allows us to extend the utility function V(·) from stationary sequences to the entire space.

    "question_context": "Every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means of their subsistence, and no species can ever multiply beyond it. But in civilized society, it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of the human species; and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce.\nThe liberal reward of labour, by enabling them to provide better for their children, and consequently to bring up a greater number, naturally tends to widen and extend those limits. It deserves to be remarked, too, that it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the demand for labour requires.\nThe wear and tear of a free servant is, in reality, as much at the expense of his master as that of the former. The wages paid to journeymen and servants of every kind must be such as may enable them, one with another to continue the race of journeymen and servants, according as the increasing, diminishing, or stationary demand of the society, may happen to require.\nThe liberal reward of labour, therefore, as it is the effect of increasing wealth, so it is the cause of increasing population. To complain of it, is to lament over the necessary cause and effect of the greatest public prosperity.\n\nThis section explores Adam Smith's observations on the relationship between labor rewards, population growth, and economic conditions, as detailed in 'The Wealth of Nations'. It covers the dynamics of labor markets, the impact of wages on worker behavior, and the effects of economic states (progressive, stationary, declining) on labor conditions.",

Average total cost (ATC) is the firm's total cost divided by its level of output $\\mathrm{TC}/\\bar{Q}$ Thus, the average total cost of producing at a rate of five units is $\\$36$ $\\$180/5$ .Basically, average total cost tells us the per-unit cost of production.\n\nThis section analyzes short-run cost structures, including fixed, variable, and marginal costs, and their implications for production decisions.",

    "question_context": "An estimator, $W$ of $\\theta$, is unbiased if for all possible values of $\\theta$, $E(W) = \\theta$.\nIf W is an estimator of $\\theta$, its bias is defined as $Bias(W) = E(W) - \\theta$.\nThe sample average $\\bar{Y}$ is an unbiased estimator of the population mean $\\mu$, regardless of the underlying population distribution: $E(\\bar{Y}) = \\mu$.\nThe sample variance $S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2$ is unbiased for $\\sigma^2$: $E(S^2) = \\sigma^2$.\nThe variance of the sample average is $Var(\\bar{Y}) = \\sigma^2 / n$.\nIf $W_1$ and $W_2$ are two unbiased estimators of $\\theta$, $W_1$ is efficient relative to $W_2$ when $Var(W_1) \\leq Var(W_2)$ for all $\\theta$, with strict inequality for at least one value of $\\theta$.\nThe mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator $W$ is defined as $MSE(W) = E[(W - \\theta)^2] = Var(W) + [Bias(W)]^2$.\n\nThis section discusses the properties of unbiased estimators, the concept of bias, and the efficiency of estimators in statistical inference. It covers the mathematical derivations of unbiasedness for sample mean and variance, and compares estimators based on their sampling distributions.",

This property is essential for the application of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to the score function, which is a key step in establishing the asymptotic normality of the CMLE.\n\nStep 2: The zero conditional mean property of the score function is given by E[s(θ0)] = 0, where s(θ) is the score function and θ0 is the true parameter value. This property is a consequence of the regularity conditions imposed on the model, including the compactness of the parameter space and the continuity of the log-likelihood function.\n\nStep 3: The asymptotic normality of the CMLE is established by applying the CLT to the score function. The CLT states that the distribution of the score function, standardized by its standard deviation, converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This result is used to derive the asymptotic distribution of the CMLE, which is given by √N(θ̂ - θ0) → d Normal(0, A0^(-1)), where θ̂ is the CMLE, θ0 is the true parameter value, N is the sample size, and A0 is the Fisher information matrix.\n\nStep 4: The zero conditional mean property of the score function is essential for the application of the CLT to the score function. Without this property, the CLT would not hold, and the asymptotic normality of the CMLE would not be established. Therefore, the zero conditional mean property of the score function is a critical component of the regularity conditions imposed on the model, and it plays a key role in the derivation of the asymptotic normality of the CMLE.\"",

Specifically, if $\\boldsymbol{l}$ units of labor are used, output $\\mathfrak{y}$ is given by $\\mathfrak{y}=\\mathfrak{x}l$, so the technology shows constant returns to scale each period.\nDefine a stationary competitive equilibrium in which money is valued to be a price function $p\\colon X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\_{+}$ and a labor supply function n: X → R+ such that $$n(x)\\in\\operatorname{argmax}\\Big\\{-H(l)+\\int V\\left[\\frac{x l\\phi(x)}{\\phi(x^{\\prime})}\\right]\\pi(x,d x^{\\prime})\\Big\\},\\quad\\mathrm{all}x\\in X;$$ $$x n(x)=M/p(x),\\quad{\\mathrm{all~}}x\\in X.$$\nUnder Assumption 17.1, the function $\\pmb{\\zeta}$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and onto. Hence the inverse function $\\zeta^{-1}\\colon\\mathbf{R}\\_{+}\\to[0,L)$ is well defined, continuous, strictly increasing, and onto. Therefore a bounded, continuous, strictly positive function ${n^{\\*}\\colon X\\to[0,L)}$ satisfies (4) if and only if the bounded, continuous, strictly positive function $f^{\\*}\\colon X\\to\\mathbf{R}\\_{++}$ defined by $f^{\\*}(x)=\\zeta[n^{\\*}(x)]$ satisfies $$f^{\\*}(x)=\\int\\phi[x^{\\prime}\\zeta^{-1}\\left(f^{\\*}(x^{\\prime})\\right)]\\pi(x,d x^{\\prime}),\\mathrm{all}x\\in X.$$\n\nThis section presents an overlapping-generations model where individuals live for two periods, working when young and consuming when old. The economy features a stochastic technology shock affecting production, and fiat money serves as the only store of value. The model is analyzed under specific assumptions about utility functions and technology.",

The elasticity of substitution measures the curvature of an isoquant.\n\nThis section covers the fundamental concepts of production technology, including the measurement of inputs and outputs, the specification of technology, and the properties of production sets. It also introduces key concepts such as the input requirement set, isoquant, and the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS).",

It is defined as the percentage change in the ratio of two inputs that is required to keep the output constant. Mathematically, it can be derived as follows: Let's consider a production process that uses two inputs, labor (L) and capital (K), to produce a single output (Y). The production function can be represented as Y = f(L, K). The isoquant is a curve that shows all the possible combinations of L and K that produce a given level of output Y. The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is the slope of the isoquant, which measures the rate at which one input can be substituted for another while keeping the output constant. The elasticity of substitution (σ) is defined as the percentage change in the ratio of L to K that is required to keep the output constant. It can be derived as follows: Step 1: Define the production function Y = f(L, K) and the isoquant equation L = g(K, Y). Step 2: Take the partial derivative of the isoquant equation with respect to K to get ∂L/∂K = ∂g/∂K. Step 3: Take the partial derivative of the isoquant equation with respect to L to get ∂L/∂L = ∂g/∂L. Step 4: Use the chain rule to express the change in the ratio of L to K as d(L/K) = (∂L/∂K) dK - (∂L/∂L) dL. Step 5: Substitute the expressions for ∂L/∂K and ∂L/∂L into the equation for d(L/K) to get d(L/K) = (∂g/∂K) dK - (∂g/∂L) dL. Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by L/K to get d(L/K) / (L/K) = (∂g/∂K) dK / L - (∂g/∂L) dL / K. Step 7: Take the limit as dK and dL approach zero to get the elasticity of substitution σ = (∂g/∂K) / (∂g/∂L). Step 8: Use the definition of the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) to express (∂g/∂K) / (∂g/∂L) as - (∂L/∂K) / (∂L/∂L). Step 9: Substitute the expression for (∂L/∂K) / (∂L/∂L) into the equation for σ to get σ = - (∂L/∂K) / (∂L/∂L).
