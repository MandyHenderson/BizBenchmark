In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economicsânot just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$.

By applying this inclusion to Î±' in place of Î± and aq in place of q, we obtain Î±/z(w,aq) c z(w,Î± (aq)), or z(w,aq) < Î±z(w,q) and thus conclude that $z(\\mathrm{w},\\alpha_{\\mathbb{Q}})=\\alpha z(\\mathrm{w},\\mathsf{q})$\nWe next prove property (viii).

To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.

It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$.

In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work.

In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$.

In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economicsânot just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point.

For Hawks and Doves to do equally well, -7p + 8(1-p) = 0p + 3(1-p). Step 5: Solve for p. -7p + 8 - 8p = 3 - 3p => -15p + 8 = 3 - 3p => -12p = -5 => p = 5/12 â 0.42. Step 6: Biological interpretation. At p â 0.42, the population reaches an evolutionary stable equilibrium where the proportion of Hawks is such that neither strategy can invade the other, maintaining a stable mix of aggressive (Hawk) and peaceful (Dove) behaviors in the population.", "error": null}}

Step 3: This inequality arises because local nonsatiation guarantees that a preferred bundle cannot be cheaper than the equilibrium bundle (if it were cheaper, the consumer would have already chosen it in equilibrium). Step 4: When we aggregate across all consumers, this leads to âpÂ·x_i > âw_i, showing the new allocation is not feasible (as total expenditure exceeds total wealth). Step 5: Thus, local nonsatiation prevents the existence of a feasible Pareto improvement over the equilibrium allocation, thereby establishing the Pareto optimality of the competitive equilibrium.", "error": null}}

Because unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed devote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive job offers.

Today, the four largest industries are autos, aircraft, communications, and electrical components. As this transition took place, jobs were created in some firms, and jobs were destroyed in others. The end result of this process has been higher productivity and higher living standards. But, along the way, workers in declining industries found themselves out of work and searching for new jobs.\nEven if some frictional unemployment is inevitable, the precise amount is not. The faster information spreads about job openings and worker availability, the more rapidly the economy can match workers and firms. The Internet, for instance, may help facilitate job search and reduce frictional unemployment. In addition, public policy may play a role. If policy can reduce the time it takes unemployed workers to find new jobs, it can reduce the economyâs natural rate of unemployment.\nOne government program that increases the amount of frictional unemployment, without intending to do so, is unemployment insurance. This program is designed to offer workers partial protection against job loss. The unemployed who quit their jobs, were fired for cause, or just entered the labor force are not eligible. Benefits are paid only to the unemployed who were laid off because their previous employers no longer needed their skills. Although the terms of the program vary over time and across states, a typical American worker covered by unemployment insurance receives 50 percent of his or her former wages for 26 weeks.\nWhile unemployment insurance reduces the hardship of unemployment, it also increases the amount of unemployment. The explanation is based on one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. Because unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed devote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive job offers. In addition, because unemployment insurance makes unemployment less onerous, workers are less likely to seek guarantees of job security when they negotiate with employers over the terms of employment.\n\nThis section explores the concept of frictional unemployment, which arises from the time it takes for workers to find jobs that match their skills and preferences. It also discusses the role of public policy and unemployment insurance in influencing job search behavior and unemployment rates.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Understand the argument that unemployment insurance (UI) improves job matching.

Step 4: Practically, this implies that researchers can use simpler estimation techniques (single-equation IV) without efficiency loss when the system is just-identified, as the estimators are equivalent to more complex system estimators in this special case.", "error": null}}

Estimate regression (8.8.3), which is appropriate if there is no parameter instability, and obtain ${\\bf R}S S_{3}$ with $\\mathrm d\\mathrm f=(n_{1}+n_{2}-k)$ , where $k$ is the number of parameters estimated, 2 in the present case. For our example $\\mathrm{RSS}_{3}=23,248.30$ . We call ${\\bf R}S S_{3}$ the restricted residual sum of squares $\\mathbf{(RSS_{R})}$ because it is obtained by imposing the restrictions that $\\lambda_{1}=\\gamma_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}=\\gamma_{2}$ , that is, the subperiod regressions are not different. 2. Estimate (8.8.1) and obtain its residual sum of squares, ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{1}$ , with $\\mathrm{df}=(n_{1}-k)$ . In our example, $\\mathrm{RSS}_{1}=1785.032$ and $\\mathrm{df}=10$ . 3. Estimate (8.8.2) and obtain its residual sum of squares, ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{2}$ , with $\\mathrm{df}=(n_{2}-k)$ . In our example, $\\mathrm{RSS}_{2}=10,005.22$ with $\\mathrm{df}=12$ . 4. Since the two sets of samples are deemed independent, we can add ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{1}$ and ${\\mathrm{RSS}}_{2}$ to obtain what may be called the unrestricted residual sum of squares $(\\mathbf{RSS_{UR}})$ , that is, obtain: $$\\operatorname{RSS}_{\\operatorname{UR}}=\\operatorname{RSS}_{1}+\\operatorname{RSS}_{2}\\qquad{\\mathrm{with~df}}=(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)$$ In the present case, $$\\mathrm{RSS}_{\\mathrm{UR}}=(1785.032+10,005.22)=11,790.252$$ 5. Now the idea behind the Chow test is that if in fact there is no structural change [i.e., regressions (8.8.1) and (8.8.2) are essentially the same], then the ${\\bf R}S S_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and ${\\tt R S S}_{\\mathrm{UR}}$ should not be statistically different. Therefore, if we form the following ratio: $$F=\\frac{(\\mathrm{RSS_{R}}-\\mathrm{RSS_{UR}})/k}{(\\mathrm{RSS_{UR}})/(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)}\\sim F_{[k,(n_{1}+n_{2}-2k)]}$$\n\nThis section discusses the application of the $F$ test for hypotheses about regression parameters and introduces the Chow test for detecting structural changes in regression models.

Most tests of the DF type have low power; that is, they tend to accept the null of unit root more frequently than is warranted.

It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).", "If $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$.

In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work.

In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.", "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.", "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week.

If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours.

In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economicsânot just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculusâas in Section A.5âthe definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of educationâstarting from any amount of educationâincreases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point.

Another measure of central tendency is the median. A general definition of median is too complicated for our purposes. If $X$ is continuous, then the median of $X$ , say $m$ , is the value such that one-half of the area under pdf is to the left of $m$ , and one-half of the area is to the right of $m$ .\nWhen $X$ is discrete and takes on a finite number of odd values, the median is obtained by ordering the possible values of $X$ and then selecting the value in the middle. For example, if $X$ can take on the values $\\{-4,0,2,8,10,13,17\\}$ , then the median value of $X$ is 8. If $X$ takes on an even number of values, there are really two median values; sometimes these are averaged to get a unique median value. Thus, if $X$ takes on the values $\\{-5,3,9,17\\}$ , then the median values are 3 and 9; if we average these, we get a median equal to 6.\nIn general, the median, sometimes denoted ${\\mathrm{Med}}(X)$ , and the expected value, $\\operatorname{E}(X)$ , are different. Neither is 'better' than the other as a measure of central tendency; they are both valid ways to measure the center of the distribution of $X$ . In one special case, the median and expected value (or mean) are the same. If the probability distribution of $X$ is symmetrically distributed about the value $\\mu$ , then $\\mu$ is both the expected value and the median. Mathematically, the condition is $f(\\mu+x)=f(\\mu-x)$ for all $x$ .\nFor a random variable $X$ , let $\\mu=\\operatorname{E}(X)$ . There are various ways to measure how far $X$ is from its expected value, but the simplest one to work with algebraically is the squared difference, $(X-\\mu)^{2}$ . This distance is itself a random variable since it can change with every outcome of $X$ . Just as we needed a number to summarize the central tendency of $X$ , we need a number that tells us how far $X$ is from $\\mu$ , on average. One such number is the variance, which tells us the expected distance from $X$ to its mean: $$ \\operatorname{Var}(X)\\equiv\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^{2}]. $$\nAs a computational device, it is useful to observe that $$ \\sigma^{2}=\\operatorname{E}(X^{2}-2X\\mu+\\mu^{2})=\\operatorname{E}(X^{2})-2\\mu^{2}+\\mu^{2}=\\operatorname{E}(X^{2})-\\mu^{2}. $$\nTwo important properties of the variance follow: $\\operatorname{Var}(X)=0$ if and only if there is a constant $c$ , such that $\\operatorname{P}(X=c)=1$ , in which case, $\\operatorname{E}(X)=c$ . For any constants $a$ and $b$ , $\\operatorname{Var}(a X+b)=a^{2}\\operatorname{Var}(X)$ .\nThe standard deviation of a random variable, denoted $\\operatorname{sd}(X)$ , is simply the positive square root of the variance: $\\operatorname{sd}(X)\\equiv+{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)}}$ . The standard deviation is sometimes denoted $\\sigma_{X}$ , or simply $\\sigma$ , when the random variable is understood.

Step 3: Since A and B are diagonal, the only non-zero elements are aáµ¢áµ¢ and bâ±¼â±¼. Therefore, (AB)áµ¢â±¼ = aáµ¢áµ¢ * bâ±¼â±¼ if i = j, and (AB)áµ¢â±¼ = 0 if i â  j. Step 4: This means that AB is also a diagonal matrix, with its j-th diagonal element equal to aâ±¼ * bâ±¼.

If demand is inelastic, employment levels are less sensitive to wage changes. Step 2: Minimum-wage laws act as a price floor for labor, setting wages above the equilibrium level. This increases wages for some workers but reduces the quantity of labor demanded by employers. Step 3: The unintended consequence depends on the elasticity of labor demand. In sectors with elastic labor demand (e.g., low-skilled jobs), firms may respond to higher wages by significantly reducing hiring or automating tasks, leading to higher unemployment. In sectors with inelastic demand, employment levels may not drop as sharply. Step 4: The text notes that minimum-wage laws 'cause other workers to be unemployed,' highlighting this unintended consequence.

Step 3: Positive responsiveness means that if any individual's preference increases (from against to for or neutral to for), and no other preferences decrease, the collective choice should not switch from for to against. In F(xâ, xâ) = xâ, if xâ increases (e.g., from 0 to 1), F switches accordingly (0 to 1), satisfying positive responsiveness. Step 4: Neutrality between alternatives means the function treats all alternatives equally in terms of how preferences are aggregated. Since F(xâ, xâ) = xâ depends only on xâ's value (not on which alternative it represents), it satisfies neutrality between alternatives.", "error": null}}

The transformed dependent variable is $\\tilde{y}_{1} = y_{1}\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^{2}}$, and the transformed regressors are $\\tilde{x}_{10} = \\sqrt{1 - \\rho^{2}}$ and $\\tilde{x}_{11} = x_{1}\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^{2}}$. This ensures that the variance of the transformed error term is the same for all observations.

It may work better than the linear model for estimating the expected demand function.\nThe following table contains the Tobit estimates and, for later comparison, OLS estimates of a linear model:\nThe signs of the price coefficients accord with basic demand theory: the own-price effect is negative, the cross price effect for the substitute good (regular apples) is positive.\nThe null hypothesis can be stated as $\\mathrm{H}_{0}\\colon\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}=0$ . Define $\\theta_{1}=\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}$ . Then $\\hat{\\theta}_{1}=-.16$ . To obtain the $t$ statistic, I write $\\beta_{2}=\\theta_{1}-\\beta_{1}$ , plug in, and rearrange. This results in doing Tobit of ecolbs on $(e c o p r c-r e g p r c)$ , regprc, faminc, and hhsize. The coefficient on regprc is $\\hat{\\theta}_{1}$ and, of course we get its standard error: about .59. Therefore, the $t$ statistic is about $-.27$ and $p$ -value $=.78$ . We do not reject the null.\n\nThis section discusses the application of the Tobit model in estimating demand functions, comparing it with OLS estimates from a linear model.

The long-run variance of $\\{\\Delta u_t\\}$ is then $\\sigma^2 \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\psi_j - \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\psi_j \right)^2 = 0$, since $(1 - L)\\psi(L)$ evaluated at $L = 1$ is zero. This confirms that the long-run variance of $\\{\\Delta u_t\\}$ is zero.\n\nStep 3: Alternatively, using the hint, the long-run variance of $\\{v_t\\}$ (where $v_t = \\Delta u_t$) is the limit of $\text{Var}(\\sqrt{T} \bar{v})$. Since $\\sqrt{T} \bar{v} = (u_T - u_0)/\\sqrt{T}$, and $\\{u_t\\}$ is I(0) with finite variance, $\text{Var}(u_T - u_0)$ is finite. Thus, $\text{Var}(\\sqrt{T} \bar{v}) = \text{Var}(u_T - u_0)/T \to 0$ as $T \to \\infty$, confirming that the long-run variance is zero.", "error": null}}
