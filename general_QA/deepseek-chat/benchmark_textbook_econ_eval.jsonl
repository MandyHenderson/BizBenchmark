In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work.

It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$.

When demand is unit elastic (Ed = 1), the percentage change in price is exactly offset by the percentage change in quantity demanded. This means that any price change does not affect total revenue, as the gain (or loss) from higher (or lower) prices is exactly offset by the loss (or gain) in quantity sold. Step 4: Connect to the provided context. The context states that between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic, and total revenue remains the same at these two prices. This confirms that total revenue is maximized at the point where elasticity is unit elastic because any deviation from this point (either increasing or decreasing price) would not increase total revenue further. Thus, total revenue is maximized when the price elasticity of demand is unit elastic.", "error": null}}

If $X_1 \\sim \\chi_{k_1}^2$ and $X_2 \\sim \\chi_{k_2}^2$ are independent, then $F = \\frac{(X_1/k_1)}{(X_2/k_2)} \\sim F_{k_1,k_2}$. Step 2: Relate to regression. In regression analysis, we often want to test joint hypotheses about multiple coefficients (e.g., $H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = ... = \\beta_k = 0$). The test statistic for this is based on comparing the restricted model (under $H_0$) and unrestricted model. Step 3: Construct the F-statistic. The numerator is the difference in sum of squared residuals (SSR) between restricted and unrestricted models, normalized by the number of restrictions (q). This follows a $\\chi_q^2$ under $H_0$. The denominator is the SSR from the unrestricted model, normalized by degrees of freedom (n-p-1), following $\\chi_{n-p-1}^2$. Step 4: Form the ratio. The F-statistic is $F = \\frac{(SSR_{restricted} - SSR_{unrestricted})/q}{SSR_{unrestricted}/(n-p-1)}$, which under $H_0$ follows $F_{q,n-p-1}$. Step 5: Perform the test.

In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.", "There are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work.

In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.", "Another relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.", "Assume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week.

If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.", "Before leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.", "From Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).", "The exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.", "Two useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.", "In the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.", "For example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).", "In applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.", "If $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.", "Some functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$", "If $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.", "In Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used.

In this text, we denote the natural logarithm, which we often refer to simply as the log function, as $$ y = \\log(x). $$\nThe function $y = \\log(x)$ is defined only for $x > 0$, and it is plotted in Figure A.4. It is not very important to know how the values of $\\log(x)$ are obtained. For our purposes, the function can be thought of as a black box: we can plug in any $x > 0$ and obtain $\\log(x)$ from a calculator or a computer.\nSeveral things are apparent from Figure A.4. First, when $y = \\log(x)$, the relationship between $y$ and $x$ displays diminishing marginal returns. One important difference between the log and the quadratic function in Figure A.3 is that when $y = \\log(x)$, the effect of $x$ on $y$ never becomes negative: the slope of the function gets closer and closer to zero as $x$ gets large, but the slope never quite reaches zero and certainly never becomes negative.\nThe following are also apparent from Figure A.4: $$ \\begin{array}{c}{{\\log(x) < 0\\mathrm{~for~}0 < x < 1}}\\\\ {{\\log(1) = 0}}\\\\ {{\\log(x) > 0\\mathrm{~for~}x > 1.}}\\end{array} $$\nSome useful algebraic facts about the log function are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{\\log(x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) + \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x_{1}/x_{2}) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{2}), x_{1}, x_{2} > 0}\\\\ &{\\log(x^{c}) = c\\log(x), x > 0, c\\mathrm{any}\\mathrm{number.}}\\end{array} $$\nThe logarithm can be used for various approximations that arise in econometric applications. First, $\\log(1 + x) \\approx x$ for $x \\approx 0$. You can try this with $x = .02$, .1, and .5 to see how the quality of the approximation deteriorates as $x$ gets larger. Even more useful is the fact that the difference in logs can be used to approximate proportionate changes. Let $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ be positive values. Then, it can be shown (using calculus) that $$ \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0}) \\approx (x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0} = \\Delta x/x_{0} $$ for small changes in $x$.\nIf we multiply equation (A.22) by 100 and write $\\Delta\\log(x) = \\log(x_{1}) - \\log(x_{0})$, then $$ 100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\%\\Delta x $$ for small changes in $x$. The meaning of small depends on the context, and we will encounter several examples throughout this text.\nWhy should we approximate the percentage change using (A.23) when the exact percentage change is so easy to compute? Momentarily, we will see why the approximation in (A.23) is useful in econometrics. First, let us see how good the approximation is in two examples.\nFirst, suppose $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 41$. Then, the percentage change in $x$ in moving from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is $2.5\\%$, using $100(x_{1} - x_{0})/x_{0}$. Now, $\\log(41) - \\log(40) = .0247$ to four digits, which when multiplied by 100 is very close to 2.5. The approximation works pretty well. Now, consider a much bigger change: $x_{0} = 40$ and $x_{1} = 60$. The exact percentage change is $50\\%$. However, $\\log(60)\\mathrm{~-~}\\log(40) \\approx .4055$, so the approximation gives $40.55\\%$, which is much farther off.\nWhy is the approximation in (A.23) useful if it is only satisfactory for small changes? To build up to the answer, we first define the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ as $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta y}{\\%\\Delta x}. $$ In other words, the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ is the percentage change in $y$, when $x$ increases by $1\\%$. This notion should be familiar from introductory economics.\nIf $y$ is a linear function of $x$, $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then the elasticity is $$ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}\\cdot\\frac{x}{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x}, $$ which clearly depends on the value of $x$. (This is a generalization of the well-known result from basic demand theory: the elasticity is not constant along a straight-line demand curve.)\nElasticities are of critical importance in many areas of applied economics—not just in demand theory. It is convenient in many situations to have constant elasticity models, and the log function allows us to specify such models. If we use the approximation (A.23) for both $x$ and $y$, then the elasticity is approximately equal to $\\Delta\\log(y)/\\Delta\\log(x)$. Thus, a constant elasticity model is approximated by the equation $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ and $\\beta_{1}$ is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$ (assuming that $x, y > 0$).\nIf $q$ is quantity demanded and $p$ is price, and these variables are related by $$ \\log(q) = 4.7 - 1.25\\log(p), $$ then the price elasticity of demand is $-1.25$. Roughly, a $1\\%$ increase in price leads to a $1.25\\%$ fall in the quantity demanded.\nFor our purposes, the fact that $\\beta_{1}$ in (A.26) is only close to the elasticity is not important. In fact, when the elasticity is defined using calculus—as in Section A.5—the definition is exact. For the purposes of econometric analysis, (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model. Such models play a large role in empirical economics.\nThere are other possibilities for using the log function that often arise in empirical work. Suppose that $y > 0$, and $$ \\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x. $$ Then $\\Delta\\log(y) = \\beta_{1}\\Delta x$, so $100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(y) = (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x$. It follows that, when $y$ and $x$ are related by equation (A.27), $$ \\%\\Delta y \\approx (100\\cdot\\beta_{1})\\Delta x. $$\nSuppose that hourly wage and years of education are related by $$ \\log(wage) = 2.78 + .094educ. $$ Then, using equation (A.28), $$ \\%\\Delta wage \\approx 100(.094)\\Delta educ = 9.4\\Delta educ. $$ It follows that one more year of education increases hourly wage by about $9.4\\%$.\nGenerally, the quantity $\\%\\Delta y/\\Delta x$ is called the semi-elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$. The semi-elasticity is the percentage change in $y$ when $x$ increases by one unit. What we have just shown is that, in model (A.27), the semi-elasticity is constant and equal to $100\\cdot\\beta_{1}$. In Example A.6, we can conveniently summarize the relationship between wages and education by saying that one more year of education—starting from any amount of education—increases the wage by about $9.4\\%$. This is why such models play an important role in economics.\nAnother relationship of some interest in applied economics is: $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x), $$ where $x > 0$. How can we interpret this equation? If we take the change in $y$, we get $\\Delta y = \\beta_{1}\\Delta\\log(x)$, which can be rewritten as $\\Delta y = (\\beta_{1}/100)[100\\cdot\\Delta\\log(x)]$. Thus, using the approximation in (A.23), we have $$ \\Delta y \\approx (\\beta_{1}/100)(\\%\\Delta x). $$ In other words, $\\beta_{1}/100$ is the unit change in $y$ when $x$ increases by $1\\%$.\nAssume that the labor supply of a worker can be described by $$ hours = 33 + 45.1\\log(wage), $$ where wage is hourly wage and hours is hours worked per week. Then, from (A.30), $$ \\Delta hours \\approx (45.1/100)(\\%\\Delta wage) = .451\\%\\Delta wage. $$ In other words, a $1\\%$ increase in wage increases the weekly hours worked by about .45, or slightly less than one-half of an hour. If the wage increases by $10\\%$, then $\\Delta hours = .451(10) = 4.51$, or about four and one-half hours. We would not want to use this approximation for much larger percentage changes in wages.\nBefore leaving this section, we need to discuss one more special function, one that is related to the log. As motivation, consider equation (A.27). There, $\\log(y)$ is a linear function of $x$. But how do we find $y$ itself as a function of $x$? The answer is given by the exponential function. We will write the exponential function as $y = \\exp(x)$, which is graphed in Figure A.5.\nFrom Figure A.5, we see that $\\exp(x)$ is defined for any value of $x$ and is always greater than zero. Sometimes the exponential function is written as $y = e^{x}$, but we will not use this notation. Two important values of the exponential function are $\\exp(0) = 1$ and $\\exp(1) = 2.7183$ (to four decimals).\nThe exponential function is the inverse of the log function in the following sense: $\\log[\\exp(x)] = x$ for all $x$, and $\\exp[\\log(x)] = x$ for $x > 0$. In other words, the log 'undoes' the exponential, and vice versa. (This is why the exponential function is sometimes called the anti-log function.) In particular, note that $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ is equivalent to $$ y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x). $$ If $\\beta_{1} > 0$, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ has the same shape as in Figure A.5. Thus, if $\\log(y) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$ with $\\beta_{1} > 0$, then $x$ has an increasing marginal effect on $y$. In Example A.6, this means that another year of education leads to a larger change in wage than the previous year of education.\nTwo useful facts about the exponential function are $\\exp(x_{1} + x_{2}) = \\exp(x_{1})\\exp(x_{2})$ and $\\exp[c\\cdot\\log(x)] = x^{c}$.\nIn the previous section, we asserted several approximations that have foundations in calculus. Let $y = f(x)$ for some function $f$. Then, for small changes in $x$, $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{d f}{d x}\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $d f/d x$ is the derivative of the function $f$ evaluated at the initial point $x_{0}$. We also write the derivative as $d y/d x$.\nFor example, if $y = \\log(x)$, then $d y/d x = 1/x$. Using (A.31), with $d y/d x$ evaluated at $x_{0}$, we have $\\Delta y \\approx (1/x_{0})\\Delta x$, or $\\Delta\\log(x) \\approx \\Delta x/x_{0}$, which is the approximation given in (A.22).\nIn applying econometrics, it helps to recall the derivatives of a handful of functions because we use the derivative to define the slope of a function at a given point. We can then use (A.31) to find the approximate change in $y$ for small changes in $x$. In the linear case, the derivative is simply the slope of the line, as we would hope: if $y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x$, then $d y/d x = \\beta_{1}$.\nIf $y = x^{c}$, then $d y/d x = c x^{c-1}$. The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of the derivatives: $d[f(x) + g(x)]/d x = d f(x)/d x + d g(x)/d x$. The derivative of a constant times any function is that same constant times the derivative of the function: $d[c f(x)]/d x = c[d f(x)/d x]$. These simple rules allow us to find derivatives of more complicated functions. Other rules, such as the product, quotient, and chain rules will be familiar to those who have taken calculus, but we will not review those here.\nSome functions that are often used in economics, along with their derivatives, are $$ \\begin{array}{r l}&{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x + \\beta_{2}x^{2}; d y/d x = \\beta_{1} + 2\\beta_{2}x}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}/x; d y/d x = -\\beta_{1}/(x^{2})}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\sqrt{x}; d y/d x = (1/2)x^{-1/2}}\\\\ &{y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}/x}\\\\ &{y = \\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x); d y/d x = \\beta_{1}\\exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x).}\\end{array} $$\nIf $\\beta_{0} = 0$ and $\\beta_{1} = 1$ in this last expression, we get $d y/d x = \\exp(x)$, when $y = \\exp(x)$.\nIn Section A.4, we noted that equation (A.26) defines a constant elasticity model when calculus is used. The calculus definition of elasticity is $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y}$. It can be shown using properties of logs and exponentials that, when (A.26) holds, $\\frac{d y}{d x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = \\beta_{1}$.\nWhen $y$ is a function of multiple variables, the notion of a partial derivative becomes important. Suppose that $$ y = f(x_{1}, x_{2}). $$ Then, there are two partial derivatives, one with respect to $x_{1}$ and one with respect to $x_{2}$. The partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x_{1}$, denoted here by $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}$, is just the usual derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{1}$, where $x_{2}$ is treated as a constant. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}}$ is just the derivative of (A.32) with respect to $x_{2}$, holding $x_{1}$ fixed.\nPartial derivatives are useful for much the same reason as ordinary derivatives. We can approximate the change in $y$ as $$ \\Delta y \\approx \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}}\\cdot\\Delta x_{1}, \\mathrm{~holding~} x_{2} \\mathrm{~fixed}. $$ Thus, calculus allows us to define partial effects in nonlinear models just as we could in linear models. In fact, if $$ y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2}, $$ then $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = \\beta_{1}, \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = \\beta_{2}. $$ These can be recognized as the partial effects defined in Section A.2.\nA more complicated example is $$ y = 5 + 4x_{1} + x_{1}^{2} - 3x_{2} + 7x_{1}\\cdot x_{2}. $$ Now, the derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{1}$ (treating $x_{2}$ as a constant), is simply $$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{1}} = 4 + 2x_{1} + 7x_{2}; $$ note how this depends on $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. The derivative of (A.34), with respect to $x_{2}$, is $\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_{2}} = -3 + 7x_{1}$, so this depends only on $x_{1}$.\n\nThis section covers the natural logarithm function, its properties, and its applications in econometrics.

It is calculated as (Percentage change in quantity demanded of Good 1) / (Percentage change in price of Good 2). Step 2: Recognize that a negative cross-price elasticity indicates the two goods are complements. This means that when the price of Good 2 increases, the quantity demanded of Good 1 decreases, and vice versa. Step 3: Provide an example. A classic example is printers and ink cartridges. If the price of printers (Good 2) increases, fewer printers are sold, leading to a decrease in the demand for ink cartridges (Good 1). Step 4: Explain the economic intuition. Complements are goods that are typically used together. When the price of one complement rises, consumers buy less of it, which reduces the need for the other complement. Hence, the negative relationship captured by the negative cross-price elasticity.", "error": null}}

This means that the $j$-step kernel is obtained by summing over all possible intermediate states $s_{t+1}$ the product of the $(j-1)$-step kernel from $s_{t+1}$ to $s_{t+j}$ and the one-step kernel from $s_{t}$ to $s_{t+1}$.\n\nStep 5: Repeat the recursion until the desired $j$-step kernel is obtained. For example, to compute $Q_{2}(s_{t+2}|s_{t})$, you would sum over $s_{t+1}$ the product $Q_{1}(s_{t+2}|s_{t+1}) Q_{1}(s_{t+1}|s_{t})$.", "error": null}}

Step 2: Calculate the deadweight loss (DWL) using the formula for the area of a triangle. The DWL is the loss in total surplus due to the price ceiling and is represented by the area between the supply and demand curves from the quantity supplied under the ceiling (18 Tcf) to the equilibrium quantity (which we need to calculate). Step 3: Find the equilibrium quantity. Plug the equilibrium price ($2.00) and oil price ($8.00) into either the supply or demand equation to find the equilibrium quantity. Using the supply equation: Q = 14 + 2(2) + 0.25(8) = 14 + 4 + 2 = 20 Tcf. Step 4: Calculate the DWL. The DWL is the area of the triangle formed by the difference between the equilibrium quantity (20 Tcf) and the quantity supplied under the ceiling (18 Tcf), and the difference between the equilibrium price ($2.00) and the price at which demand equals the quantity supplied under the ceiling. First, find the price at which demand equals 18 Tcf. Using the demand equation: 18 = -5P_G + 3.75(8) => 18 = -5P_G + 30 => -5P_G = -12 => P_G = $2.40. The height of the DWL triangle is the difference between this price ($2.40) and the ceiling price ($1.00), which is $1.40. The base of the triangle is the difference between the equilibrium quantity (20 Tcf) and the quantity supplied under the ceiling (18 Tcf), which is 2 Tcf. Therefore, DWL = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 2 * 1.4 = $1.4 billion. Step 5: Illustrate graphically. The graph would show the supply and demand curves intersecting at the equilibrium price of $2.00 and quantity of 20 Tcf.

This is because each additional unit of output requires increasingly more labor (due to decreasing MP_L), driving up the marginal cost of production. Step 4: The upward slope of the MC curve is a direct consequence of diminishing returns to labor, as captured by the inverse relationship between MC and MP_L.", "error": null}}

The problem involves an insurance agency designing an optimal unemployment compensation scheme where the worker's effort (job search intensity) is unobservable, leading to potential moral hazard.

For each candidate (μ, σ²), simulate S draws of z* ~ N(μ, σ²) and compute the simulated moments:  \n- m₁*(μ, σ²) = (1/S) Σ z*_s  \n- m₂*(μ, σ²) = (1/S) Σ (z*_s - m₁*)²  \n\nStep 4: Formulate the MSM estimator. The estimator minimizes the distance between sample and simulated moments:  \n(μ̂, σ̂²) = argmin [ (m - m*(μ, σ²))' W (m - m*(μ, σ²)) ],  \nwhere m = [m₁, m₂]', m* = [m₁*, m₂*]', and W is a weighting matrix.  \n\nStep 5: Derive the asymptotic covariance matrix. Under standard regularity conditions, the MSM estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. The asymptotic covariance matrix accounts for both sampling variability and simulation noise. It is given by:  \nAsyVar(μ̂, σ̂²) = (1 + 1/S) (G'WG)⁻¹ G'WΩWG (G'WG)⁻¹,  \nwhere:  \n- G = ∂m*(μ, σ²)/∂(μ, σ²) is the Jacobian of the simulated moments,  \n- Ω is the variance of the sample moments (which depends on higher moments of z),  \n- S is the number of simulations.  \n\nStep 6: Compute G and Ω for the lognormal case. For the lognormal distribution:  \n- G = [1, 0; 0, 1] (since the moments are linear in μ and σ²),  \n- Ω = Var([z_t, (z_t - μ)²]') = [σ², μ₃; μ₃, μ₄ - σ⁴], where μ₃ and μ₄ are the third and fourth central moments of z.  \n\nStep 7: Plug into the asymptotic covariance formula. With G = I (identity matrix) and W = Ω⁻¹ (optimal weighting), the covariance simplifies to:  \nAsyVar(μ̂, σ̂²) = (1 + 1/S) Ω.  \nFor the lognormal case, this becomes:  \nAsyVar(μ̂, σ̂²) = (1 + 1/S) [σ², μ₃; μ₃, μ₄ - σ⁴].  \nThis accounts for both sampling variability (via Ω) and simulation randomness (via the (1 + 1/S) term).", "error": null}}

Otherwise, the firm could increase its profit by raising or lowering total output.\nAlgebraically, profit is $$ \\pi=P Q_{T}-C_{1}(Q_{1})-C_{2}(Q_{2}) $$ The firm should increase output from each plant until the incremental profit from the last unit produced is zero. Setting incremental profit from output at plant 1 to zero: $$ {\\frac{\\Delta\\uppi}{\\Delta Q_{1}}}={\\frac{\\Delta(P Q_{T})}{\\Delta Q_{1}}}-{\\frac{\\Delta C_{1}}{\\Delta Q_{1}}}=0 $$ Here $\\Delta(P Q_{\\mathrm{T}})/\\Delta Q_{1}$ is the revenue from producing and selling one more unit, i.e., marginal revenue, MR, for all of the firm's output. The next term, $\\Delta C_{1}/\\Delta Q_{1},$ is marginal cost at plant 1, MC1. We thus have $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{\\imath}=0$ Or $$ \\mathbf{MR}=\\mathbf{MC}_{1} $$ Similarly, setting incremental profit from output at plant 2 to zero, $$ \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C}_{2} $$ Putting these relations together, we see that the firm should produce so that $$ \\boxed{\\mathrm{MR}=\\mathrm{MC}_{1}=\\mathrm{MC}_{2}} $$\nFigure 10.6 illustrates this for a firm with two plants. $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C}_{2}$ are the marginal cost curves for the two plants. Also shown is a curve labelled ${\\bf M C}_{T}$ This is the firm's total marginal cost and is obtained by horizontally summing MC1 and $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{C}_{2}$.\n\nThis section extends the profit maximization problem to a firm with multiple plants, deriving the optimal allocation of production across plants to equalize marginal costs.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Write the profit function for the multiplant monopolist.

Step 3: For r = 0.5, the utility function becomes U(x1, x2) = (x1^0.5 + x2^0.5)^2. Step 4: The Marshallian demands for CES utility are given by: x1 = w * p1^(k-1) / (p1^k + p2^k) and x2 = w * p2^(k-1) / (p1^k + p2^k), where k = r/(r-1). Step 5: Calculate k: k = 0.5/(0.5 - 1) = -1. Step 6: Plug in the given values p1 = 1, p2 = 1, w = 10, and k = -1 into the demand functions: x1 = 10 * (1)^(-2) / (1^(-1) + 1^(-1)) = 10 * 1 / (1 + 1) = 5.

Step 3: Determine the real income redistribution. A higher $P_t/P_c$ means urban goods become relatively more expensive compared to rural goods. Since towns pay for rural provisions with urban goods, the town effectively gets more rural goods (provisions) per unit of urban goods exported. This redistributes real income from the country to the town: rural inhabitants receive fewer urban goods for their provisions, while urban inhabitants receive more provisions for their urban goods. Step 4: Link to Smith's critique. The regulations enable this redistribution by distorting the natural price equilibrium, allowing urban corporations to exploit their market power at the expense of rural producers.", "error": null}}

Step 4: Under the assumption that E[𝐗₂|𝐗₁] is linear in 𝐗₁, we have E[𝐗₂|𝐗₁] = 𝐗₁𝐏₁.₂. Thus, the expected forecast becomes E[𝐗₁𝐛₁] = 𝐗₁β₁ + E[𝐗₂|𝐗₁]β₂, which is exactly the conditional mean of 𝐲 given 𝐗₁. Therefore, the forecast is unbiased. Step 5: The implications for prediction are that omitting variables may bias the coefficient estimates but does not necessarily bias the forecasts, provided the conditional mean E[𝐗₂|𝐗₁] is linear in 𝐗₁. If the conditional mean is nonlinear, the forecast may still be biased.", "error": null}}

Step 2: Able workers can acquire education as a signal to distinguish themselves from unable workers, as they have lower costs of acquiring this signal. In equilibrium, able workers acquire education, while unable workers do not, allowing firms to pay wages based on actual MP. Step 3: The education itself does not increase the worker's MP; its sole purpose is to signal ability. This makes the investment in education 'socially wasteful' because resources (time, effort, money) are spent on a signal that does not enhance productivity or create value for society. Step 4: From a social welfare perspective, this waste reduces overall welfare because these resources could have been allocated to productive activities that increase societal output or utility. Instead, they are used purely for redistribution (separating able from unable workers) without any net gain in productivity or welfare.", "error": null}}

Economists use the term tax incidence to refer to these questions about the distribution of a tax burden.", "The initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream.

Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream.", "The direction of the shift is easy to determine.

As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently, downward), as shown in Figure 6-6.", "We can, in this case, be precise about how much the curve shifts.

Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve downward from $D_1$ to $D_2$ by exactly the size of the tax ($\\$0.50$)."], "question_context": "To analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question: When the government levies a tax on a good, who bears the burden of the tax? The people buying the good? The people selling the good? Or, if buyers and sellers share the tax burden, what determines how the burden is divided? Economists use the term tax incidence to refer to these questions about the distribution of a tax burden.\nThe initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The supply curve is not affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the same incentive to provide ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have to pay a tax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they buy ice cream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream.\nThe direction of the shift is easy to determine. Because the tax on buyers makes buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of ice cream at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently, downward), as shown in Figure 6-6.\nWe can, in this case, be precise about how much the curve shifts. Because of the $\\$0.50$ tax levied on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $\\$0.50$ higher than the market price. For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be $\\$2.00$, the effective price to buyers would be $\\$2.50$. Because buyers look at their total cost including the tax, they demand a quantity of ice cream as if the market price were $\\$0.50$ higher than it actually is.

Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve downward from $D_1$ to $D_2$ by exactly the size of the tax ($\\$0.50$).\n\nThis section examines how taxes on buyers and sellers affect market outcomes and the distribution of tax burdens. It uses the ice-cream market as an example to illustrate the equivalence of taxes on buyers and sellers.", "source_files": [], "category": "INVALID_QUESTION", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Understand the tax impact on demand.
