Although we expect the infant nutrition segment top-line and margin benefit to largely reverse in 2023, as supply normalizes, we believe Reckitt will be able to hold on to a fraction of the market share gained during this period at least until mid-2023, as a significantly larger number of babies are being introduced to Enfamil. Over the midterm, we believe the baby formula crisis might lead to changes in regulation that will see more foreign infant formula suppliers entering the U.S. market, increasing competition in the highly consolidated baby formula industry where just three players—Abbott, Reckitt, and Nestle—control 90% of the market. We believe this concern, together with the sustained decline in birth rates in the U.S., will weigh on volumes, leading to sluggish top-line growth for the nutrition segment of around 2% through 2026. On the other hand, we expect above-average growth in the health and hygiene segments, leading to an organic compounded annual growth rate of around 4.5% for the overall business over the next five years.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"To calculate the enterprise value/EBITDA multiple for Reckitt based on the 2023 forecast, we need to first determine the forecasted EBITDA for 2023.

Then, the fixed cost per shipment is $2.8B / V.\nStep 4: To calculate the breakeven shipment volume decline, we need to find the point at which the fixed cost per shipment equals the contribution margin per shipment. This can be represented by the equation:\n$2.8B / V = 0.4R\nStep 5: To solve for V, we can rearrange the equation to get:\nV = $2.8B / 0.4R\nStep 6: However, we need to find the decline in shipment volume that would push Saia's operating ratio above 100%. This means we need to find the point at which the revenue per shipment is equal to the fixed cost per shipment. Let's call this point V'.\nStep 7: At this point, the contribution margin per shipment is zero, and the revenue per shipment is equal to the fixed cost per shipment. We can represent this as:\nR = $2.8B / V'\nStep 8: Since the variable cost ratio is 60%, the revenue per shipment is equal to the fixed cost per shipment divided by 0.4. We can represent this as:\nR = $2.8B / (0.4V')\nStep 9: Equating the two expressions for R, we get:\n$2.8B / V' = $2.8B / (0.4V')\nStep 10: Simplifying the equation, we get:\nV' = 0.4V\nStep 11: The breakeven shipment volume decline is the difference between the original shipment volume V and the new shipment volume V'. This can be represented as:\nDecline = V - 0.4V\nDecline = 0.6V\nStep 12: To find the numerical value of the decline, we need to know the original shipment volume V. However, this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact numerical value of the decline.", "error": null}}

Therefore, the stock would receive a 4-star rating under a 'Medium' uncertainty rating.\"\n}", "model_answer": "To determine the star rating under a 'Medium' uncertainty rating, we need to calculate the margin of safety. The fair value estimate is $100, and the market price is $75. The margin of safety is the percentage difference between the market price and the fair value estimate. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the margin of safety. Margin of safety = ((Market price - Fair value estimate) / Fair value estimate) * 100\nMargin of safety = ((75 - 100) / 100) * 100 = -25%\n\nStep 2: Determine the discount or premium based on the margin of safety. Since the margin of safety is negative, it represents a premium. For a 'Medium' uncertainty rating, the premium for a 5-star rating is 35%. However, the calculated premium is 25%, which is less than the 35% premium for a 5-star rating.\n\nStep 3: Based on the calculated premium, we can determine the star rating.

The prior expectation is not explicitly stated, but we know that the new guidance midpoint is $65 million, which is 54% lower than the prior expectation. Let's denote the prior expectation as x. We can set up the equation: $65 million = x - (0.54x). Solving for x, we get x = $65 million / (1 - 0.54) = $65 million / 0.46 = $141.3 million. Now, we can calculate the percentage reduction: ((prior expectation - new guidance midpoint) / prior expectation) * 100 = (($141.3 million - $65 million) / $141.3 million) * 100 = $76.3 million / $141.3 million * 100 = 54%. However, this is the percentage decrease from the prior expectation to the new guidance midpoint. To find the percentage reduction from the prior expectation to the midpoint of its new guidance, we need to calculate the midpoint of the new guidance range. Since the new guidance is not explicitly stated, we can assume it is a range around the midpoint. Let's assume the range is symmetric around the midpoint. The percentage reduction from the prior expectation to the midpoint of its new guidance is still 54% because the midpoint of the new guidance range is also $65 million, which is 54% lower than the prior expectation.", "error": null}}

Therefore, the total assets can be calculated as: Total Assets = Net PPE + Working Capital = $3.2B + $0.8B = $4B.\n\nNow, we can calculate the capital turnover. Capital Turnover = Total Sales / Total Assets. However, we do not have the total sales. We can use the EBITDA margin to estimate the total sales. EBITDA Margin = EBIT / Sales. We know that EBITDA margin is 7.7% and EBIT is 8.4% of sales. Therefore, we can calculate the total sales as: Total Sales = EBIT / EBITDA Margin = (8.4% * Total Assets) / 7.7% = $4.3B.\n\nNow, we can calculate the capital turnover: Capital Turnover = Total Sales / Total Assets = $4.3B / $4B = 1.075.\n\nFinally, we can decompose the ROIC into operating profit margin and capital turnover: ROIC = Operating Profit Margin * Capital Turnover = 10.67% * 1.075 = 11.48%. However, we know that the actual ROIC is 7.8%. This discrepancy may be due to the simplifying assumptions made in the calculation.\n\nTo reconcile the discrepancy, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the actual operating profit: Actual Operating Profit = EBIT - Taxes = 8.4% * Total Sales - 21% * EBIT.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the actual operating profit margin: Actual Operating Profit Margin = Actual Operating Profit / Total Sales.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the actual capital turnover: Actual Capital Turnover = Total Sales / Total Assets.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the actual ROIC: Actual ROIC = Actual Operating Profit Margin * Actual Capital Turnover.\n\nUsing the given data, we can calculate the actual operating profit as: Actual Operating Profit = 8.4% * $4.3B - 21% * (8.4% * $4.3B) = $0.36B.\n\nNow, we can calculate the actual operating profit margin: Actual Operating Profit Margin = $0.36B / $4.3B = 8.37%.\n\nNext, we can calculate the actual capital turnover: Actual Capital Turnover = $4.3B / $4B = 1.075.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the actual ROIC: Actual ROIC = 8.37% * 1.075 = 9.01%.

This growth rate is relatively low compared to the industry average, which may indicate that the company's growth prospects are limited.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Stage II Investment Rate\nThe Stage II Investment Rate of 36.4% suggests that the company plans to invest a significant portion of its earnings in capital expenditures, research and development, and other growth initiatives. This high investment rate may indicate that the company is committed to growth and is willing to take on debt to finance its investments.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the implications on long-term valuation\nGiven the Stage II EBI Growth Rate and Stage II Investment Rate, we can infer that the company's long-term valuation will be driven by its ability to generate cash flows and return on investment. The high investment rate may lead to increased debt levels, which could negatively impact the company's credit rating and cost of capital.

In a world where VantageScore gains traction, we believe the most likely outcome is that the credit bureaus spin it out to maximize shareholder value. Even if VantageScore becomes a formidable number 2, we would expect the credit scoring market to be a rational oligopoly rather than one where pricing competes away returns above cost of capital.\n\nFair Isaac's moat trend is considered stable due to its aggressive pricing strategy and minimal competitive impact.

According to the provided data, the EBITDA for 2027 is $1,006 million. The base case FCFF can be calculated using the formula: FCFF = EBITDA + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Interest Expenses. However, the provided data does not include the depreciation and capital expenditures for 2027. Therefore, we cannot calculate the base case FCFF without making some assumptions.\n\nAssuming that the depreciation and capital expenditures for 2027 are similar to those in 2026, we can use the data from 2026 to estimate the base case FCFF. In 2026, the EBITDA was $932 million, depreciation was $143 million, capital expenditures were $287 million, and interest expenses were $-1.3 billion (which is a negative value, indicating that the company generated more cash from interest expenses than it paid). \n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the base case FCFF for 2027 as follows:\n\nFCFF = EBITDA + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Interest Expenses\n= $1,006 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $1,006 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million\n\nNow, let's perform a 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA. A 10% increase in EBITDA would be $1,006 million + 10% of $1,006 million = $1,006 million + $100.6 million = $1,106.6 million. A 10% decrease in EBITDA would be $1,006 million - 10% of $1,006 million = $1,006 million - $100.6 million = $905.4 million.\n\nUsing the same formula as above, we can calculate the FCFF for the 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA:\n\nFCFF with 10% increase in EBITDA = $1,106.6 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $3,708 million\n\nFCFF with 10% decrease in EBITDA = $905.4 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $2,018 million\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity analysis on the FCFF for 2027, assuming a 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA, results in a FCFF of $3,708 million and $2,018 million, respectively.\"\n}", "model_answer": "To perform a sensitivity analysis on the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for 2027, assuming a 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA, we need to first calculate the base case FCFF for 2027. According to the provided data, the EBITDA for 2027 is $1,006 million. The base case FCFF can be calculated using the formula: FCFF = EBITDA + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Interest Expenses. However, the provided data does not include the depreciation and capital expenditures for 2027. Therefore, we cannot calculate the base case FCFF without making some assumptions.\n\nAssuming that the depreciation and capital expenditures for 2027 are similar to those in 2026, we can use the data from 2026 to estimate the base case FCFF. In 2026, the EBITDA was $932 million, depreciation was $143 million, capital expenditures were $287 million, and interest expenses were $-1.3 billion (which is a negative value, indicating that the company generated more cash from interest expenses than it paid). \n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the base case FCFF for 2027 as follows:\n\nFCFF = EBITDA + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Interest Expenses\n= $1,006 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $1,006 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million\n\nNow, let's perform a 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA. A 10% increase in EBITDA would be $1,006 million + 10% of $1,006 million = $1,006 million + $100.6 million = $1,106.6 million. A 10% decrease in EBITDA would be $1,006 million - 10% of $1,006 million = $1,006 million - $100.6 million = $905.4 million.\n\nUsing the same formula as above, we can calculate the FCFF for the 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA:\n\nFCFF with 10% increase in EBITDA = $1,106.6 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $3,708 million\n\nFCFF with 10% decrease in EBITDA = $905.4 million + $143 million - $287 million - $-1.3 billion\n= $2,852 million + $143 million - $287 million + $1.3 billion\n= $2,018 million\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity analysis on the FCFF for 2027, assuming a 10% increase and decrease in EBITDA, results in a FCFF of $3,708 million and $2,018 million, respectively.", "error": null}}

To calculate the year-over-year growth rate in Q1 2022, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Assume the average loans in Q1 2021 is 100 (arbitrary value for calculation purposes).\nStep 2: Calculate the average loans in Q1 2022 using the year-over-year growth rate of 5%: 100 + (100 * 0.05) = 105.\nStep 3: Calculate the average loans in Q1 2022 using the 2% decline in 2021: 100 - (100 * 0.02) = 98.\nStep 4: Since we have two different values for the average loans in Q1 2022, we can calculate the year-over-year growth rate using either value.

As a result, Kroger's financial statements will show a lower net income and EPS for 2022 compared to what would have been reported without the LIFO charge. However, management's expectation of full-year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 suggests that the company is confident in its ability to recover from the LIFO charge and maintain its profitability in the long term. The LIFO charge may also impact Kroger's future profitability by reducing its cash reserves and increasing its debt burden, which could limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives and respond to future market challenges.", "error": null}}

This, in turn, would negatively affect operating income and cash flows.\n\nStep 3: The firm's exposure to overseas market risks further exacerbates its uncertainty. Economic, cultural, and political risks in these markets can lead to decreased investor confidence, resulting in outflows from AllianceBernstein's funds. This would negatively impact operating income and cash flows.\n\nStep 4: AllianceBernstein's high dependence on management and performance fees makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in fund flows and market movements. This vulnerability is reflected in its High Uncertainty Rating, indicating the potential for significant volatility in its operating income and cash flows.", "error": null}}

This moat enables NVIDIA to maintain high profit margins and resist competition from new entrants. Exemplary capital allocation, on the other hand, refers to the company's ability to allocate its resources efficiently, prioritizing investments that generate high returns. This is evident from NVIDIA's increasing free cash flow to the firm, which has grown from $38.2 billion in 2020 to $51.8 billion in 2022. The company's ability to generate strong cash flows and maintain a high return on equity (ROE) of 35.8% in 2022 suggests that its capital allocation strategy is effective. Furthermore, NVIDIA's high cash reserves and low debt levels provide a buffer against potential downturns and enable the company to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments. Overall, NVIDIA's economic moat and exemplary capital allocation position the company for sustained long-term growth and make it an attractive investment opportunity.", "error": null}}

An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.

Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to derive our annual free cash flow forecast. Stage II: Fade The second stage of our model is the period it will take the company’s return on new invested capital—the return on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage.

Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game that involves up to 50 players. Essentially, the players are placed onto an island to search for weapons in order to eliminate other players; the goal is to remain the last player standing as stockpiling weapons and supplies within the game is required to win. Free Fire was developed in house by Garena in 2018 and provided the catalyst for gaming revenue to jump to USD 4.3 billion in 2021 from USD 462 million in 2018. Quarterly active users grew during this time to 689 million from 170 million as well, which reflects the immensely success of the game. Free Fire was the most downloaded game in 2019. The network effect for Free Fire satisfies an on-demand experience where gamers can join a game anytime due to the large user base. It also contributes to variability and social elements in game play, given the number of different users, which also has contributed to the replayability and appeal of the game. revenue base for Garena, given the performance of similar games of its type, most notably PUBG, which was released in December 2017. Free Fire resembles PUBG—so much that it was sued for copyright infringement by PUBG’s developer. According to third-party data, PUBG was the highest global grossing game in 2020 and 2021, while Free Fire placed fourth and eighth, respectively. Free Fire remains the highest-grossing game in Latin America and Southeast Asia and ranked second globally by average monthly active users for all mobile games on Google Play in the third quarter of 2021. Given the current popularity of Free Fire and the performance and similarity of PUBG, we believe there is some longevity for the franchise in the near term.

Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game that involves up to 50 players. Essentially, the players are placed onto an island to search for weapons in order to eliminate other players; the goal is to remain the last player standing as stockpiling weapons and supplies within the game is required to win. Free Fire was developed in house by Garena in 2018 and provided the catalyst for gaming revenue to jump to USD 4.3 billion in 2021 from USD 462 million in 2018. Quarterly active users grew during this time to 689 million from 170 million as well, which reflects the immensely success of the game. Free Fire was the most downloaded game in 2019. The network effect for Free Fire satisfies an on-demand experience where gamers can join a game anytime due to the large user base. It also contributes to variability and social elements in game play, given the number of different users, which also has contributed to the replayability and appeal of the game. revenue base for Garena, given the performance of similar games of its type, most notably PUBG, which was released in December 2017. Free Fire resembles PUBG—so much that it was sued for copyright infringement by PUBG’s developer. According to third-party data, PUBG was the highest global grossing game in 2020 and 2021, while Free Fire placed fourth and eighth, respectively. Free Fire remains the highest-grossing game in Latin America and Southeast Asia and ranked second globally by average monthly active users for all mobile games on Google Play in the third quarter of 2021. Given the current popularity of Free Fire and the performance and similarity of PUBG, we believe there is some longevity for the franchise in the near term.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific information about the investment gains. Therefore, we will assume that the adjusted net income from Step 1 is the best estimate we can make.\n  Step 3: To calculate the normalized net income, we need to know the expected net income before the retrocession benefit. The context states that the reported net income is 27% higher than expected, but it does not provide the expected net income. Therefore, we cannot calculate the normalized net income.\n  However, we can calculate the normalized net income as a percentage of the expected net income. Let's assume the expected net income is X. Then, the reported net income is 1.27X (27% higher). We can set up the equation: 1.27X - EUR 313 million = EUR 143 million. Solving for X, we get X = EUR 143 million / 0.27 = EUR 529.63 million.\n  Step 4: Now, we can calculate the normalized net income as a percentage of the expected net income: (EUR 143 million / EUR 529.63 million) * 100% ≈ 27.0%.\n  However, this is not the normalized net income, but rather the percentage of the expected net income that the adjusted net income represents.

issues.\nIn this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit on a cumulative or midcycle basis.\nIf we deem the probability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not characterize the company as possessing an economic moat.\nCombining our analysts’ financial forecasts with the firm’s economic moat helps us assess how long returns on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm’s cost of capital.\nReturns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.\nOur model is divided into three distinct stages: Stage I: Explicit Forecast, Stage II: Fade, and Stage III: Perpetuity.\nIn this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending.\nBased on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to derive our annual free cash flow forecast.\nThe second stage of our model is the period it will take the company’s return on new invested capital—the return on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital.\nDuring the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I.\nThe length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company’s economic moat.\nWe forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat companies).\nDuring this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease.\nThe investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a perpetuity value is calculated.\nIn the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage.\nOnce a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula.\nAt perpetuity, we assume that any growth or decline or investment in the business neither creates nor destroys value and that any new investment provides a return in line with estimated WACC.\nBecause a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present value of expected future cash flows.\nBecause we are modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash available to provide a return to all capital providers—we discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using expected future proportionate long-term, market-value weights.\nMorningstar’s Uncertainty Rating is designed to capture the range of potential outcomes for a company’s intrinsic value.\nThis rating is used to assign the margin of safety required before investing, which in turn explicitly drives our stock star rating system.\nThe Uncertainty Rating is aimed at identifying the confidence we should have in assigning a fair value estimate for a given stock.\n\nThis section covers detailed financial
