This rating indicates how reliable the fair value estimate is, with higher uncertainty suggesting less confidence in the estimate.\\nStep 4: The current market price of the stock is compared to the fair value estimate. However, the weight given to this comparison is adjusted based on the Uncertainty Rating. For stocks with high uncertainty, the discount or premium to fair value needs to be larger for the stock to receive a higher star rating, as there is more risk associated with the estimate. Conversely, for stocks with low uncertainty, a smaller discount or premium can result in a higher star rating, reflecting greater confidence in the accuracy of the fair value estimate.", "error": null}}

Based on these factors, we see light at the end of the tunnel, although we do not think the company is out of the woods yet. Macro conditions are deteriorating and DocuSign saw some lengthening deal cycles and smaller deals in real estate and financial services. Based on these factors, we are maintaining our fair value estimate of $88 per share, and see upside to shares, but advise investors to proceed with caution given recent missteps.\nDocuSign announced Dan Springer is out as CEO of the company. He has been replaced by Chairman of the Board Maggie Wilderotter on an interim basis as the firm begins a search for a permanent CEO. Wilderotter has been on the board since March 2018 and previously served as the CEO of Frontier Communications from 2006 through 2015. While no time frame was provided, we would expect a new CEO to be named within approximately six months. Given her extensive leadership experience, we expect no issues with Wilderotter leading the company during this transitionary period.We maintain our fair value estimate of $88 per share for this narrowmoat company.\nDocuSign reported first-quarter results that exceeded the high end of guidance for revenue and were slightly above the midpoint for non-GAAP operating margin. That said, the firm is still experiencing sales execution issues and consequently lowered its billings outlook. Adding fuel to the fire, management also noted it was moderating its hiring, but did not raise its full-year profitability outlook. We interpret the billings outlook combined with the fact that existing customers have significantly slowed their expansion with DocuSign as signs that post-COVID-19 normalization is even more severe than we had previously modeled. Management admitted as much on the call. Based on these factors, we materially lower growth and profitability assumptions throughout our explicit 10-year DCF forecast, which in turn lowers our fair value estimate to $88 per share, from $130 previously.\nWhile DocuSign reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded the high end of guidance for revenue and hit the midpoint for non-GAAP operating margin, we are significantly reducing our value estimate to $130 per share, from $244 per share, based on fiscal 2023 guidance that was meaningfully short of our model, which was already below FactSet consensus. Guidance combined with sales execution issues have diminished our confidence in DocuSign's longer-term outlook. We are therefore lowering our annual growth forecast by approximately five points and our margin expectations by approximately one point in each year of our discrete 10-year forecast as we struggle to define DocuSign's normalized financial model post-COVID-19.\n\nDocuSign's recent financial performance and valuation adjustments based on earnings reports and analyst notes.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"The significance of DocuSign's non-GAAP operating margin being at the high end of guidance indicates strong operational efficiency and cost control, which is positive for profitability.

An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm’s cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm’s cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.", "Our model is divided into three distinct stages: Stage I: Explicit Forecast In this stage, which can last five to 10 years, analysts make full financial statement forecasts, including items such as revenue, profit margins, tax rates, changes in working-capital accounts, and capital spending. Based on these projections, we calculate earnings before interest, after taxes (EBI) and the net new investment (NNI) to derive our annual free cash flow forecast. Stage II: Fade The second stage of our model is the period it will take the company’s return on new invested capital—the return on capital of the next dollar invested (“RONIC”)—to decline (or rise) to its cost of capital. During the Stage II period, we use a formula to approximate cash flows in lieu of explicitly modeling the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement as we do in Stage I. The length of the second stage depends on the strength of the company’s economic moat. We forecast this period to last anywhere from one year (for companies with no economic moat) to 10–15 years or more (for wide-moat companies). During this period, cash flows are forecast using four assumptions: an average growth rate for EBI over the period, a normalized investment rate, average return on new invested capital (RONIC), and the number of years until perpetuity, when excess returns cease. The investment rate and return on new invested capital decline until a perpetuity value is calculated. In the case of firms that do not earn their cost of capital, we assume marginal ROICs rise to the firm’s cost of capital (usually attributable to less reinvestment), and we may truncate the second stage. Stage III: Perpetuity Once a company’s marginal ROIC hits its cost of capital, we calculate a continuing value, using a standard perpetuity formula. At perpetuity, we assume that any growth or decline or investment in the business neither creates nor destroys value and that any new investment provides a return in line with estimated WACC. Because a dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow, we discount our projections of cash flows in stages I, II, and III to arrive at a total present value of expected future cash flows. Because we are modeling free cash flow to the firm—representing cash available to provide a return to all capital providers—we discount future cash flows using the WACC, which is a weighted average of the costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock (and any other funding sources), using expected future proportionate long-term, market-value weights."], "question_context": "We are reaffirming our narrow moat and stable moat trend ratings.

The Morningstar Rating for stocks identifies stocks trading at an uncertainty-adjusted discount or premium to their intrinsic worth—or fair value estimate, in Morningstar terminology. Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount to their fair values whereas 1-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic worth.\nFour key components drive the Morningstar rating: (1) our assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process ultimately culminates in our single-point star rating.\nThe concept of an economic moat plays a vital role not only in our qualitative assessment of a firm's long-term investment potential, but also in the actual calculation of our fair value estimates. An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time. We define economic profits as returns on invested capital (or ROIC) over and above our estimate of a firm's cost of capital, or weighted average cost of capital (or WACC). Without a moat, profits are more susceptible to competition. We have identified five sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.\nCompanies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to achieve normalized excess returns for at least the next 10 years. Wide-moat companies are those in which we have very high confidence that excess returns will remain for 10 years, with excess returns more likely than not to remain for at least 20 years. The longer a firm generates economic profits, the higher its intrinsic value. We believe low-quality, no-moat companies will see their normalized returns gravitate toward the firm's cost of capital more quickly than companies with moats.\nWhen considering a company's moat, we also assess whether there is a substantial threat of value destruction, stemming from risks related to ESG, industry disruption, financial health, or other idiosyncratic issues. In this context, a risk is considered potentially value destructive if its occurrence would eliminate a firm’s economic profit on a cumulative or midcycle basis. If we deem the probability of occurrence sufficiently high, we would not characterize the company as possessing an economic moat.\nTo assess the sustainability of excess profits, analysts perform ongoing assessments of the moat trend. A firm's moat trend is positive in cases where we think its sources of competitive advantage are growing stronger; stable where we don't anticipate changes to competitive advantages over the next several years; or negative when we see signs of deterioration.\nCombining our analysts' financial forecasts with the firm's economic moat helps us assess how long returns on invested capital are likely to exceed the firm's cost of capital. Returns of firms with a wide economic moat rating are assumed to fade to the perpetuity period over a longer period of time than the returns of narrow-moat firms, and both will fade slower than no-moat firms, increasing our estimate of their intrinsic value.

We use the formula for the present value of an annuity: PV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r, where C is the cash flow per period, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods. For Stage I, C = $100M, r = 8%, and n = 5. Thus, PV_StageI = $100M * [1 - (1 + 0.08)^-5] / 0.08 = $399.27M.\\\\\"\r\n  \r  \r  \r :\r\n\r\n  \"Step 2: Calculate the present value of Stage II cash flows.

FV_StageI = $100M * (1 + 0.08)^5 = $146.93M. Then, we calculate the present value of the growing annuity for Stage II using the formula: PV = C * [(1 - (1 + g)^n / (1 + r)^n) / (r - g)], where C is the initial cash flow, r is the discount rate, g is the growth rate, and n is the number of periods. For Stage II, C = $146.93M, r = 8%, g = 3%, and n = 10. Thus, PV_StageII = $146.93M * [(1 - (1 + 0.03)^10 / (1 + 0.08)^10) / (0.08 - 0.03)] = $1,242.45M.\\\\\"\r\n  \r  \r  \r ,\r\n\r\n  \"Step 3: Calculate the present value of the perpetuity.

For the perpetuity, C = $146.93M * (1 + 0.03)^10 = $194.98M, r = 8%, and g = 2%.
