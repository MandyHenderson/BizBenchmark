But as we saw in Chapter 3, in a competitive economy factors of production are paid their marginal product--the real wage of workers in terms of cloth is equal to the marginal productivity of labor in cloth production, and so on. When the ratio of land to labor rises in producing either good, the marginal product of labor in terms of that good increases--so workers find their real wage higher in terms of both goods. On the other hand, the marginal product of land falls in both industries, so landowners find their real income lower in terms of both goods.\nAn increase in the supply of land shifts the economy's production possibility frontier outward from $TT^{1}$ to $TT^{2}$, but does so disproportionately in the direction of food production. The result is that at an unchanged relative price of cloth (indicated by the slope $-P_{C}/P_{F}$), cloth production actually declines from $Q_{C}^{1}$ to $Q_{C}^{2}$.\n\nThis section explores the relationship between factor prices (wage rate and rental rate on land) and goods prices (cloth and food) in a two-factor economy.

The price of Home's exports (cloth) falls relative to its imports (food).\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\nCapital accumulation in Home, with cloth being capital-intensive, leads to:\n- A rightward shift of the world RS curve\n- A decrease in the relative price of cloth\n- A deterioration in Home's terms of trade\n- An improvement in Foreign's terms of trade", "error": null}}

At this cutoff, the participation constraint just binds. This means that for income realizations $\\bar{y}_s > \\bar{y}(v)$, the participation constraint binds ($\\lambda_s > 0$), while for $\\bar{y}_s ≤ \\bar{y}(v)$, it doesn't ($\\lambda_s = 0$).\n\nStep 3: Compute the cutoff.\nAt the cutoff, both conditions must hold simultaneously.

Therefore:\n$m_K(λx) = m_K(-|λ|x) = |λ|m_K(x)$\n\nStep 4: Verify positive homogeneity for $λ = 0$.\n$m_K(0) = \\inf\\{α ≥ 0 : 0 ∈ αK\\}$. Since $K$ is balanced, $0 ∈ K$, so $0 ∈ αK$ for any $α > 0$. Thus, $m_K(0) = 0 = 0·m_K(x)$ for any $x$.\n\nStep 5: Verify subadditivity.\nLet $x, y$ be any vectors. For any $ε > 0$, there exist $α_x, α_y > 0$ such that:\n- $x ∈ (m_K(x) + ε)K$\n- $y ∈ (m_K(y) + ε)K$\n\nSince $K$ is convex, for any $t ∈ [0,1]$, we have $tK + (1-t)K ⊆ K$.\n\nLet $α_x = m_K(x) + ε$ and $α_y = m_K(y) + ε$. Then:\n$x + y ∈ α_xK + α_yK = (α_x + α_y)(\\frac{α_x}{α_x + α_y}K + \\frac{α_y}{α_x + α_y}K) ⊆ (α_x + α_y)K$\n\nTherefore, $x + y ∈ (m_K(x) + m_K(y) + 2ε)K$, which implies:\n$m_K(x + y) ≤ m_K(x) + m_K(y) + 2ε$\n\nSince this holds for any $ε > 0$, we can conclude:\n$m_K(x + y) ≤ m_K(x) + m_K(y)$\n\nHaving verified positive homogeneity and subadditivity, we have proven that the Minkowski gauge $m_K$ of a balanced convex absorbent set $K$ is indeed a semi-norm.", "error": null}}

Then $g$ drops to . $50(.16)=.08$.\nNow we can use our general DCF formula to find the capitalization rate $r$: $$P_{0}=\\frac{\\mathrm{DIV}_{1}}{1+r}+\\frac{\\mathrm{DIV}_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{DIV}_{3}+P_{3}}{(1+r)^{3}}$$\nWe have to use trial and error to find the value of $r$ that makes $P_{0}$ equal $\\$50.$ It turns out that the $r$ implicit in these more realistic forecasts is approximately .099, quite a difference from our 'constant-growth' estimate of .21.\n\nThis section discusses the application of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to firms with varying growth rates, highlighting the limitations of the constant-growth DCF formula and the importance of realistic growth assumptions.", "source_files": [], "category": "INVALID_QUESTION", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "", "model_answer": "Error", "error": "错误：API 调用失败 -> Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': '当前分组 Claude 上游模型 claude-3-7-sonnet-latest 负载已饱和，请稍后再试 (request id: 2025051420210718819048407841961)', 'type': 'rate_limit_error', 'param': '', 'code': None}}"}}

This can be expressed as:\nY = AD\n\nStep 2: Components of aggregate demand\nAggregate demand consists of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (NX):\nAD = C + I + G + NX\n\nStep 3: Expressing consumption function\nConsumption typically depends on autonomous consumption (C₀) and induced consumption based on disposable income (Y-T), where T represents taxes:\nC = C₀ + c(Y-T)\nwhere c is the marginal propensity to consume (0 < c < 1)\n\nStep 4: Investment function\nInvestment is often modeled as dependent on the interest rate (i):\nI = I₀ - di\nwhere I₀ is autonomous investment and d is the sensitivity of investment to interest rates\n\nStep 5: Substituting into the equilibrium condition\nY = C₀ + c(Y-T) + I₀ - di + G + NX\n\nStep 6: Solving for Y\nY = C₀ + cY - cT + I₀ - di + G + NX\nY - cY = C₀ - cT + I₀ - di + G + NX\nY(1-c) = C₀ - cT + I₀ - di + G + NX\nY = [C₀ - cT + I₀ - di + G + NX]/(1-c)\n\nStep 7: Deriving the IS curve\nThe IS curve shows combinations of interest rates (i) and output (Y) that maintain goods market equilibrium. Rearranging to express i as a function of Y:\ni = [C₀ - cT + I₀ + G + NX - (1-c)Y]/d\n\nThis is the equation of the IS curve with a negative slope of -(1-c)/d.\n\nStep 8: Effect of an increase in autonomous consumer expenditure (C₀)\nWhen C₀ increases, the numerator in the IS equation increases. For any given interest rate (i), this requires a higher level of output (Y) to maintain equilibrium. Graphically, this shifts the entire IS curve to the right.\n\nStep 9: Economic interpretation\nAn increase in autonomous consumption means households are spending more regardless of their income level. This additional spending increases aggregate demand directly. To maintain equilibrium in the goods market, output must increase at every interest rate level, which is represented by the rightward shift of the IS curve from IS₁ to IS₂ as mentioned in the context.", "error": null}}

investors that devaluation was imminent\n\nStep 3: Crisis Acceleration (November-December 1994)\n- A second political assassination in November triggered heightened concerns\n- The presidential transition on December 1 created additional uncertainty\n- These events intensified devaluation rumors, creating a feedback loop:\n  a) Interest rates jumped significantly as investors demanded greater compensation for risk\n  b) Foreign reserves were nearly completely exhausted as the central bank tried to defend the peso\n\nStep 4: Crisis Culmination\n- With reserves nearly depleted, the central bank could no longer defend the fixed exchange rate\n- The government was forced to devalue the peso in December 1994\n- The crisis represented a classic balance of payments crisis where maintaining the fixed exchange rate became unsustainable due to reserve depletion\n\nThis case illustrates how investor expectations can become self-fulfilling in a balance of payments crisis, with the decline in reserves and rise in interest rates serving as both symptoms and accelerants of the crisis.", "error": null}}

As shown in the example, a $1,000 investment over 45 years at 10% interest would grow to $72,900 without taxes, but only to $13,800 with a 40% tax rate on interest income.\n4. The system creates additional penalties through double taxation - corporate profits are taxed first through corporate income tax, and then again when distributed as dividends through individual income tax.\n\nConsumption Tax System:\n1. Under a consumption tax, households are taxed only on what they spend.\n2. Income that is saved is exempt from taxation until it is later withdrawn and spent on consumption goods.\n3. This system does not immediately tax the act of saving or the returns on savings.\n\nWhy Economists Argue a Consumption Tax Would Increase Saving:\n\n1. Elimination of the savings penalty: Under a consumption tax, the act of saving itself is not taxed, removing the immediate disincentive to save.\n\n2. No tax on returns until consumption: The returns on investments (interest, dividends, capital gains) would not be taxed until the money is withdrawn for consumption, allowing investments to grow tax-free.\n\n3. Compound growth advantage: As demonstrated in the example, the difference between tax-free compound growth ($72,900) and taxed returns ($13,800) is dramatic over long periods.\n\n4. Elimination of double taxation: A consumption tax would eliminate the double taxation problem where corporate profits are taxed at both the corporate and individual levels.\n\n5. Deferred taxation incentive: The ability to defer taxes by saving creates a direct financial incentive to save more of one's income.", "error": null}}

If the true price of firm $A$ without the merger is $\\$500$ , the market value of $\\mathrm{firm}A$ may actually be above $\\$500$ when merger negotiations take place.\nOf course, $\\mathrm{firm}A$ could purchase firm $B$ with common stock instead of cash. Unfortunately, the analysis is not as straightforward here. In order to handle this scenario, we need to know how many shares are outstanding in firm $B$ . We assume that there are 10 shares outstanding, as indicated in column 2 of Table 30.8.\nWhether to finance an acquisition by cash or by shares of stock is an important decision. The choice depends on several factors, as follows: 1. Overvaluation. 2. Taxes. 3. Sharing Gains.\nThe corporate charter refers to the articles of incorporation and corporate bylaws that govern the firm. The corporate charter establishes the conditions that allow a takeover. Firms frequently amend corporate charters to make acquisitions more difficult.\n\nThis section discusses the role of diversification in mergers and acquisitions, the NPV analysis of mergers, and the implications of financing mergers with cash versus common stock.

This increases the amount of cash held by the company and the amount of stocks and bonds held by the public. Such an issue of securities is known as a primary issue and it is sold in the primary market.\nBut in addition to helping companies to raise cash, financial markets also allow investors to trade stocks or bonds between themselves. For example, Ms. Watanabe might decide to raise some cash by selling her Sony stock at the same time that Mr. Hashimoto invests his savings in Sony. So they make a trade. The result is simply a transfer of ownership from one person to another, which has no effect on the company’s cash, assets, or operations. Such purchases and sales are known as secondary transactions and they take place in the secondary market.\nFinancial institutions act as financial intermediaries that gather the savings of many individuals and reinvest them in the financial markets. For example, banks raise money by taking deposits and by selling debt and common stock to investors. They then lend the money to companies and individuals.\nFinancial intermediaries contribute in many ways to our individual well-being and the smooth functioning of the economy. Here are some examples: The Payment Mechanism, Borrowing and Lending, Pooling Risk.\nThe basic functions of financial markets are the same the world over. So it is not surprising that similar institutions have emerged to perform these functions.

The demand for capital follows the same principle as the demand for other factors of production (like labor): firms increase the quantity of capital hired until the value of capital's marginal product equals the rental price.\n3. The demand curve for capital reflects the marginal productivity of capital.\n\nWhile the context doesn't explicitly state the mathematical relationship between purchase price and rental price, it implies that the rental price represents the periodic cost of using capital, while the purchase price represents the total cost of ownership.", "error": null}}

However, the context doesn't explicitly address demand-side effects.\n\nStep 5: Determine the new equilibrium.\nWith a leftward shift in supply and assuming demand remains constant, economic theory would predict:\n- A higher equilibrium price (higher rents)\n- A lower equilibrium quantity (fewer housing units with windows)\n\nStep 6: Reconcile with Smith's statement.\nAdam Smith states that the tax 'lowers rents' which seems contradictory to standard supply-demand analysis. This can be explained by considering that Smith is referring to the net rent received by landlords after paying the tax, not the gross rent paid by tenants. As he states, 'The more a man pays for the tax, the less, it is evident, he can afford to pay for the rent.'\n\nStep 7: Conclusion.\nIn a competitive market framework:\n- Gross rents (what tenants pay) would likely rise due to the leftward shift in supply\n- Net rents (what landlords receive after tax) would fall\n- The tax burden is shared between landlords and tenants, with the exact distribution depending on the elasticities of supply and demand\n- The tax creates inefficiency by reducing the quantity of housing with windows in the market", "error": null}}

Our approach is distinguished by its systematic use of recursive methods, methods that make it possible to treat a wide variety of dynamic economic problems—both deterministic and stochastic—from a fairly unified point of view.\n\nThis section explores the application of recursive methods in economic dynamics, focusing on problems involving dynamic programming, fixed-point theorems, and equilibrium analysis in stochastic environments.", "source_files": [], "category": "INVALID_QUESTION", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"To derive the Bellman equation for the stochastic Ramsey problem, I'll work through the formulation step by step:\n\nStep 1: Define the state variables.

As an incentive not to shirk, a firm must offer workers a higher wage.\nFigure 17.5 shows shirking in the labor market. The demand for labor $D_{L}$ is downward-sloping for the traditional reasons. If there were no shirking, the intersection of $D_{L}$ with the supply of labor $(S L)$ would set the market wage at $w^{\\*}$ , and full employment would result $(L^{\\*})$ . With shirking, however, individual firms are unwilling to pay $w^{\\*}$ . Rather, for every level of unemployment in the labor market, firms need to pay some wage greater than $w^{\\*}$ to induce workers to be productive. This wage is shown as the no-shirking constraint (NSC) curve.\nIn 1914, when the going wage for a day's work in industry averaged between $\\$2$ and $\\$3$ Ford Motor Company introduced a pay policy of $\\$5$ a day for its workers. Improved labor efficiency (not generosity) was behind this policy. The goal was to attract better workers who would stay with their jobs, and eventually to increase profits.\n\nThis section explores the implications of asymmetric information in labor markets, focusing on incentive schemes and efficiency wage theory. It discusses how firms design compensation structures to mitigate shirking and enhance productivity, using historical examples like Ford Motor Company to illustrate these concepts.", "source_files": [], "category": "CORRECT", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"The NSC curve never crosses the labor supply curve because it represents the minimum wage firms must pay to prevent shirking, which is always above the market-clearing wage w*.

This is because the area of a triangle is calculated as (1/2) × base × height.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing what happens when tax size changes\n- When the tax size doubles: both the base and height of the triangle double, causing the area (deadweight loss) to increase by a factor of 4 (2² = 4)\n- When the tax size triples: both the base and height triple, causing the area to increase by a factor of 9 (3² = 9)\n\nStep 4: Explaining why this occurs\nThe deadweight loss increases with the square of the tax size because:\n1. A larger tax creates a bigger gap between the price paid by buyers and the price received by sellers\n2. This larger gap reduces the quantity traded in the market more significantly\n3.

This means that policymakers face a trade-off: they can achieve lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation, or they can achieve lower inflation at the cost of higher unemployment. This is the traditional short-run Phillips Curve.\n\nStep 2: Natural rate of unemployment\nAs mentioned in the context, the goal for high employment should not seek zero unemployment but rather the 'natural rate of unemployment' where labor demand equals labor supply. This represents full employment in the economy.\n\nStep 3: Long-run considerations\nIn the long run, the trade-off between inflation and unemployment disappears. The economy tends to return to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate. This creates a vertical long-run Phillips Curve at the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nStep 4: Price stability benefits\nThe context notes that 'price stability is desirable because a rising price level (inflation) creates uncertainty in the economy, and that uncertainty might hamper economic growth.' This suggests that while pursuing lower unemployment through expansionary monetary policy might seem beneficial in the short run, the resulting inflation could create economic uncertainty that harms growth in the long run.\n\nStep 5: Central bank approach\nCentral banks use intermediate and operating targets to balance these goals, as they can 'more quickly judge whether its policies are on the right track, rather than waiting until it sees the final outcome of its policies on employment and the price level.'
