    "question_context": "Present federal tax law encourages thrift institutions to invest heavily in residential mortgages through a special \"bad debt\" reserve deduction under Section 593 of the Internal Revenue Code. This deduction allows thrifts to deduct up to 40% of taxable income as a noncash addition to their bad debt reserve if a specified percentage of assets is held in qualifying forms. The marginal income tax rate for qualifying thrifts is effectively reduced to 27.6% (60% of 46%), compared to the standard corporate rate of 46%. \n\nTo qualify for the maximum 40% deduction, S&Ls must hold 82% of assets in qualifying forms, while mutual savings banks must hold 72%. The deduction rate decreases incrementally as the percentage of qualifying assets falls below these thresholds, cutting off completely at 60% for S&Ls and 50% for mutual savings banks. This provision acts as a significant barrier to diversification for profitable thrifts, as nonqualifying investments would need to yield substantially higher pretax returns to offset the lost tax benefits.

The financial asymmetry is that the AE country has lower risk aversion than the EME country. There are no trade frictions other than (potentially) regulations imposed by each country limiting capital inflows or domestic leverage. Because international financial markets are imperfect, financial crises occur in equilibrium and are inefficient due to the pecuniary externality arising from limited equity issuance. Because individual agents do not internalize their impact on asset prices, they borrow too much during booms and sell too quickly during busts, which amplifies shocks. As a result, global output depends endogenously on the relative share of wealth in each country, and debt imbalances (i.e., capital inflows or leverage) create volatility that increases the fraction of the time the global economy spends with misallocated capital. Higher leverage and capital inflows lead to a better static allocation of capital and higher growth at the cost of increased volatility that hurts dynamic global stability. A social planner would impose prudential controls in both the AE and the EME because countries use too much leverage in the laissez-faire competitive equilibrium. This result is consistent with the evidence in Boar et al. (2017) that countries that more frequently use macroprudential tools, all else equal, experience stronger and less volatile GDP growth. The asymmetric role of bearing global financial instability creates different incentives for AEs and EMEs to use prudential policies. Because markets are incomplete and agents do not internalize the pecuniary externality, the so-called 'exorbitant privilege' (excess return) from intermediating global risk does not sufficiently compensate AEs for the so-called 'exorbitant duty' (losses in crises) of being the primary bearer of financial instability. Therefore, AEs have incentives to impose marginally tighter prudential regulations to 'regulate away' sources of long-run financial instability (decreasing the frequency and duration of crises), which benefits AEs at the expense of EMEs.

This method includes the creation of pairs that are comparable for all covariates, but for directors’ propensity to donate. As a result, it assures with greater confidence that the variation in IPO value and performance can be ascribed to the variation in the test variable (DPCs). Initially, we run a probit regression to estimate propensity scores, that is, the probability of receiving the treatment (i.e., DPCs) conditional on a set of selected variables. For each treatment firm with DPCs, we select a matching control firm without DPCs from the same year, with the requirement that the absolute difference of the propensity score among pairs does not exceed 0.01. We apply this method without repetition and estimate the propensity score for each firm, after considering a set of controls that essentially capture all of the firm and IPO characteristics used in the baseline regression. We also include Fama–French industry membership, because some industries (e.g., computer equipment and services) are more likely to feature directors that have made political money contributions than others (e.g., food products). Panel B of Table 7 presents the results for the average treatment effect for those IPOs with directors involved in political contributions in comparison to those with no political involvement by directors.

Key empirical results show that this effect is stronger under specific conditions. First, firms with greater dependence on external financing (measured by low cash flow from operations or absence of dividends) benefit more from cross-ownership, as the reduction in adverse selection matters more when internal funds are scarce. Second, the effect is amplified in more competitive product markets (measured by low Herfindahl-Hirschman index or high industry entry rate), where institutional cross-owners help mitigate capital providers' concerns about competitive uncertainty.

Bondholders will not be favored by any further long-term decline in interest rates, and will be subject to the risks of short-term upward movements and the loss of purchasing power with rising price levels. The period ahead holds forth stronger promise for the holder of variable income securities (common stocks, second-grade bonds and preferred stocks). Prospects for economic growth and greater economic stability will be reflected in higher business sales, profits, and dividends. Greater stability in many formerly highly cyclical industries will admit companies with leverage capitalizations to investment portfolios. The investor will probably be well advised, therefore, to avoid industries where the threat of government antitrust action may be large, and where the effects of such action upon profits are clearly unfavorable.",

    "question_context": "The model developed in this paper is a theoretical model of residential real estate transactions. Our model builds on the sequential search-and-match model proposed in Krainer and LeRoy (2002). All households either already own a house and are enjoying the housing services (i.e., are matched) or are currently searching for one (i.e., are unmatched). As such, this is a model for house choice rather than for a homeownership decision. We begin with listing seven key assumptions and then proceed to describing the model in detail.  \n\nAssumption 1. The economy consists of an equal number of houses and households.  \nAssumption 2. Households are of two distinct classes, long-tenure and short-tenure, equally represented in the economy.  \nAssumption 3. The housing market consists of two types of houses, good and bad, equally represented in the economy.  \nAssumption 4. Prospective buyer visits two houses randomly.  \nAssumption 5. In every period, a household can buy only one house.  \nAssumption 6. Households are risk-neutral.  \nAssumption 7. A seller offers her or his house for sale for a take-it-or-leave-it price.  \n\nThe difference in expected housing tenure can be expressed using probabilities of preserving the match with the housing services during each period of homeownership, with the probability for long-tenure households being higher than for short-tenure households:  \n\n$$  \n\\pi^{L}>\\pi^{S}.  \n$$  \n\nHouses differ in the maximum level of fit that each can provide to prospective homeowners. The assumption of two types of houses allows for their price levels to be different at equilibrium. Without loss of generality, we rescale these fits: we take the minimum to be zero for both house types but the maximum fit for good houses to be one and for bad houses to be θ, 0<θ≤1. The parameter θ is exogenous. We have:  \n\n$$  \n\\varepsilon_{G}^{i}\\sim U[0,1],\\quad i=S,L,  \n$$  \n\n$$  \n\\varepsilon_{B}^{i}\\sim U[0,\\theta],\\quad i=S,L.  \n$$  \n\nThe supports of the two distributions overlap for the following two reasons. First, this satisfies the model assumption that the fit drops to zero if the match with housing services during homeownership is lost, regardless of the house type, as will be discussed next. Second, it allows for the possibility that, when both houses are visited, certain features of a bad house make it more preferable than a good house.",

For a non-financial corporation with risk-free bonds as assets, X = Mi, and the value of the firm is V = (1-τ)M. This implies that the after-tax yield at which the stock of a risk-free corporation sells is the interest rate on risk-free bonds without deducting the corporate income tax.

The main objective of these adjustments was to reduce a source of volatility and uncertainty arising from the changes in the fair value of banks’ securities portfolio (Chisnall, 2000; Allen and Carletti, 2008; Heaton et al., 2010), to preserve some of the characteristics of regulatory capital sought by supervisors in terms of quality. However, the crisis has prompted debate on whether prudential filters have been an obstacle to the early identification of problems (Laux, 2012). Filters allow some losses not to be recognised in regulatory capital, thus generating an over-estimation of the capital available to absorb losses in a crisis that can lead banks to take riskier positions since solvency ratios appear to be sufficient. The inclusion of unrealised gains and losses, whether temporary or not, may induce bank regulatory discipline, as such inclusion better reflects the underlying position. Under Basel III this filter will no longer be available, raising questions about its potential effect on banks’ behaviour. The relevance of this change will depend on the size of the gains and losses to be removed, the majority of which correspond to those arising from available-for-sale (AFS) securities, i.e. securities that are bought with the intention of not engaging in active trading with them. On average, $10\\%$ of European banks’ total assets are held in portfolios that give rise to such gains and losses and, for most jurisdictions, the largest amount of AFS securities (around $80\\%$ ) are debt securities.

    "question_context": "The MBF approach detailed above crucially depends on the frequentist $p$-value and therefore suffers from many of the same issues that plague the $p$-value itself. One such issue is that a $p$-value usually does not tell us how well a model explains the data. For example, an investment factor that has a large $t$-statistic under cross-sectional tests may not help explain the cross-section of expected returns, that is, there may be a discrepancy between statistical significance and model adequacy. Given the discussion above, this discrepancy is not hard to understand. A classical $p$-value measures the degree of incompatibility between observed data and the null hypothesis, but cannot tell us what would happen under alternative hypotheses. It is possible that both the null and the alternative hypothesis have poor explanatory power vis-a-vis the data.\n\nIn contrast, a full-blown Bayesian approach depends less on the frequentist $p$-value as it explicitly compares the evidence (i.e., likelihood) under the alternative hypotheses with the evidence under the null hypothesis. Even if we have a small frequentist $p$-value, which implies a large discrepancy between the model and the data under the null hypothesis, we may still fail to 'reject the null' under a full-blown Bayesian approach as this discrepancy could be equally large under alternative hypotheses. In other words, compared to the full-blown Bayesian approach, we may 'reject the null' too often under the MBF. This is consistent with the notion that the MBF might be too aggressive, where 'aggressive' implies more rejections of the null. However, while the MBF might be too aggressive, it still evaluates the data under alternative hypotheses. Moreover, the usual $p$-value under NHST is far more aggressive and leads to unacceptable rates of false discoveries.",

However, we have argued that variance calculated ex post is ambiguous in that there is more than one variance associated with each series of stock prices. Moreover, our two experiments have revealed that these different variances give conflicting results, as the ranking of firms depends on which variance estimate is chosen. Of course, if we lived in a world where the distributions of expected returns (stock prices in the present case) were both normal and stationary, such problems would not arise, but our experiments suggest that this is not the situation.\n\nThe question of the time period over which to calculate variance is principally related to the problem of making ex ante decisions from ex post data.

However, we have argued that variance calculated ex post is ambiguous in that there is more than one variance associated with each series of stock prices. Moreover, our two experiments have revealed that these different variances give conflicting results, as the ranking of firms depends on which variance estimate is chosen. Of course, if we lived in a world where the distributions of expected returns (stock prices in the present case) were both normal and stationary, such problems would not arise, but our experiments suggest that this is not the situation.\n\nThe question of the time period over which to calculate variance is principally related to the problem of making ex ante decisions from ex post data. Taking a particular time interval for computation equally weights all the observations within that period, while other observations receive no weight. This may not be the optimal technique for forming expectations of the future from past information.",

Real personal disposable income in 1946 was 48 per cent greater than in 1939 and 59 per cent greater than in 1929. The real value of the stock of liquid assets at the end of 1945 was 116 per cent greater than in 1939. But the stock of housing and the flow of housing services had lagged far behind. The real value of the stock of automobiles was probably even less than in 1929 or 1939. The supplying of a flow of durable goods consumption services comparable to the flow in 1929 and 1939 called for a stupendous increase of the stock of housing, automobiles, and other durable goods. The postwar period has called for building up stock to a level providing services appropriate not only to the 1946 level of income, but also to the increases in real income since that time. Real disposable income in 1953 was 94 per cent greater than in 1929 and 81 per cent greater than in 1939. If the demand for services of houses and other durable goods increased accordingly, it was necessary to nearly double the stock of these goods which we had at these earlier dates.\n\nEven if real disposable income had not been higher at, and after, the end of World War II than before the war, the depletion of stocks during the war made for a much greater demand for accretions to the stock than before the war. The demand contributed to higher income and for still greater demand for the services of the goods and, therefore, for still further increases in the stocks of the goods.\n\nIn addition to the depleted stocks of durable consumer goods at the end of the war, large stocks of liquid assets, and high levels of income, some other factors have probably contributed to an increase in the stock of consumer durable goods necessary to meet the demand for their services. Consumer debt and debt service charges were at a very low level. Consumer house debt at the end of 1945 was equal to 12 per cent of disposable income compared with 16 per cent in 1940 and service charges on the debt to 2 per cent in 1945 compared with 3 per cent in 1940. The amount of other consumer instalment debt was 2 per cent of disposable income in 1945 compared with 7 per cent in 1940, while the repayments were 3 compared with 10 per cent.

Where ex ante investments are noncontractible, nonrecourse secured debt avoids ex post bargaining and appropriately bonds the redeployer’s performance by making him a residual claimant to the asset’s highest feasible bad-state value. This analysis applies to the activities of other intermediaries as well. Implicit in the lender’s identification of the asset’s next best use is an assessment of its value in the critical state that separates the good and bad states.

As with the full scope of redeployment activities, accurate valuation looked at in isolation may be noncontractible and subject to gains from ex ante investment. If valuation is left until the bad state occurs, for example, a sales agent will have too little incentive to search for a better price because he captures only a share of the gains. And the entrepreneur benefits from an ex ante valuation of the primary use of the asset to better determine his optimal level of investment. The model’s results fit nicely with the events following airline deregulation. Many aircraft loans met with default by failing carriers, and many carriers voluntarily relinquished aircraft.

Hence, we propose a plausible mechanism for the flight home effect, where banks with a higher probability to receive a bailout increase their home bias. Our estimates show that tougher restrictions in the lender country limit the banks’ shift towards domestic borrowers. Arguably, the freeze in domestic economic activity induces banks to explore lending opportunities abroad. On the other hand, expansionary monetary policy (in the form of lower repo rates and open market purchases) reinforces the lenders’ flight towards domestic borrowers. According to our findings, the flight home effect is not driven by international banks’ desire to rebalance their portfolios towards borrowers of higher quality, as development status and institutional quality in the host country are irrelevant for the banks’ flight to domestic borrowers.",

The model controls for board characteristics (BOIND, BOSIZE) and block holdings (BLOCK), which show no significant moderating effects (Table 4: BOIND t=0.98-1.57, BLOCK t=-2.11-0.79).",

Consequently, the average investor would probably think of a convertible as being less risky than common stock, but more risky than straight bonds. Assuming that marginal investors are risk averters, expected yields on convertibles should lie between those on stocks and those on non-convertible debt, which suggests that market forces will drive a firm's convertible bonds to a point along an appropriate iso-yield curve. However, this is not necessarily correct. Suppose, for example, that investors require an 8 per cent rate of return on the company's common stock, $4\\%$ per cent on its straight-debt, and 6 per cent on its convertibles. This would mean that the firm could set a 2 per cent coupon and a $\\$40.00$ conversion price (Point B), a 4.0 per cent coupon and a $\\$50$ conversion price (Point A), or any other combination along the 6 per cent yield curve. Intuition tells one, however, that the first situation is more risky than the second. With the coupon set at 4 per cent, most of the return is from interest, while with a 2 per cent coupon the expected yield is derived largely from capital gains. In general, the higher up the vertical axis we go on any yield curve the more dependent the yield is on capital gains, and consequently the greater the risk of not attaining the indicated yield. This leads to the conclusion that the firm's trade-off opportunity curve is something other than an iso-yield curve, and such a situation is illustrated by Figure 3. Eqns.

In our setting, salary likely proxies for a number of unobservable variables that are beyond the monetary compensation. It may proxy for the quality of other faculty, better facilities, better resources for research and other nonpecuniary benefits that affect new hire's satisfaction with her placement. Notably, the variables that proxy for candidates being graduates of the 4th and 5th quintile of school ranking are also significant while controlling for the salary level (see Model 1). This result may be explained by the fact that candidates from lower ranked schools are satisfied because they found a job. Throughout the job market process, they receive fewer interviews, fewer fly-out invitations, and fewer job offers. Therefore, if a candidate from a top school is confident about her prospects of finding a job, she derives satisfaction from securing a higher compensation; a candidate from a lower tier school may derive satisfaction from simply securing a job. This conclusion is supported by the fact that predominantly the candidates from the bottom two quintiles are sometimes unsuccessful in securing a job when first on the job market (see Figs. 2, 3, and Section 5.3). In addition, we find that candidates with prior publications are more satisfied with the job offer. This result suggests that prior publications serve as a signal of candidate's quality, and quality candidates tend to receive better job offers. Similarly, candidates who are confident at the fly-out stage are more satisfied with the secured job. This result could also be related to the candidate's quality as higher quality candidates may be more confident about their prospects of securing the job.",

The terms of trade hedge arises from the nonlinear behavior of P_{a,t}/P_{b,t}, which provides insurance to the AE during downturns by increasing dividend yields from good a production. The volatility σ_{η} exhibits sudden jumps during financial crises, reflecting systemic risk amplification through fire sales and capital misallocation.",

In a typical arrangement, a financial institution agrees to make payments to the homeowner for a specified period of time. The loan, consisting of principal and accrued interest, becomes due and payable when the borrower no longer occupies the house. Unlike the outstanding balance of a conventional mortgage, or the outstanding balance of a bond with a sinking fund provision, the outstanding balance of a reverse mortgage increases over time. If the reverse mortgage is not insured, this exposes the lender to the risk that the value of the underlying asset, the house, will not be sufficient to pay off the mortgage when it becomes due. Therefore, the default risk increases, rather than decreases, during the life of the loan. The second major difference between a reverse mortgage and other fixed-income securities is the likelihood of an 'unanticipated termination.' For example, consider a term reverse mortgage. The borrower may cease to reside in the home prior to the fixed term of the reverse mortgage; he or she might move, die or enter a nursing home. In any of these cases, the loan becomes due. Therefore, the term is not truly fixed but may be shorter if there is an unanticipated termination. This is in contrast to typical fixed-income securities, which truly do have fixed maturity dates.",

There are many reasons why our measure of rate of return on equity might have an upward bias. The most important ones for a typical investor are as follows. (1) Transactions costs: Compared to buying and selling stocks or other financial assets, the typical home buyer faces relatively high out-of-pocket costs just to complete the transaction. The largest cost is the realtor’s fee. (2) Other transactions costs include closing costs, inspection and time spent searching for the desired home. (3) Unpaid managing costs: Managing a house requires considerably more effort than keeping track of one’s stocks, for example. The owner has to take care of a yard for many homes (or pay to have it done) and keeping the house from depreciating rapidly through constant owner-supplied labor and other tasks. (4) Measurement error associated with calculating return on equity: The measurement of equity is subject to accounting tricks more so than market value. There are a number of financial arrangements that can be made between brokerage firms and other banks and their clients to cast doubt on measures of net wealth of the clients. Essentially, these arrangements are encouraged by tax advantages to both client and firm and provide additional leverage in home ownership.

As we shall see, this theoretical relationship need not apply with special repo rates. Suppose, for example, that a given instrument sells today for $P$ and that the relevant overnight interest rate for borrowing or lending is $r$. If the instrument can be sold short at the spot price $P$, then the cost-of-carry formula for the overnight forward price is then ${\\boldsymbol{F}}={\\boldsymbol{P}}(1+{\\boldsymbol{r}})$. This is an arbitrage-based formula, in that if $F>P(1+r)$ one could commit to deliver forward, purchase the underlying instrument for $P$, and borrow the purchase cost overnight at the interest rate $r$. The payback on the loan is $P(\\mathbf{1}+r)$. The instrument can be delivered against the forward commitment, for a theoretical risk-free profit of $F-P(1+r)>0$ Likewise, if $F<P(1+r)$, one could buy forward, short the instrument, invest the sale value $P$ at the overnight interest rate, and make an arbitrage profit the next day of $P(1+r-F>0$. Thus absence of arbitrage seems to imply that $F=P(1+r)$.

Accordingly, changes in loan-supply responses to capital requirements are much stronger for small banks than for large ones (Aiyar et al., 2016). Moreover, large and small banks might have different scopes of activities, as well as contrasting business models. Small banks are more focused on lending activities and deposit taking than large banks, which are largely involved in trading and wholesale funding activities.24 This is likely to affect a bank’s ability to manage liquidity positions, different components of regulatory capital, and willingness to lend.

Besides, large U.S. banks are more involved in securitization lending than small banks. Therefore, when investing in illiquid commercial loans, large U.S. banks strengthen their financial soundness and loss absorption capacity.

These results may be explained in the context of deleveraging and the credit crunch in Europe over the post-2008 financial crisis period.

    "question_context": "The asset pricing literature has long been shaped by the idea that observable firm characteristics convey information about the cross-section of expected stock returns. A common practice in the literature is to extract the risk premium associated with these characteristics by constructing long-short (LS) factor portfolios (Fama and French,1993). Such zero-investment, market-neutral portfolios have given rise to so-called factor investing. Yet, there are benefits over and above static factor investing. Studies such as Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012), Jacobs (2015), Akbas et al. (2016), and Keloharju, Linnainmaa, and Nyberg (2016) show that the performance of LS portfolios, and therefore the benefits from factor investing, are significantly time-varying. More importantly, such time variation in performance is not harmonious across portfolios, allowing for substantial investment gains from timing factor portfolio returns.1 As such, from an investor’s perspective, timing is important, and an active factor allocation is needed in order to capitalize on the fluctuations in LS portfolio returns. A key aspect of our methodology is the use of different dimension reduction techniques to reduce the dimensions of both sides of the predictability problem. In line with Haddad, Kozak, and Santosh (2020), we begin by reducing the number of forecasting targets, recognizing the underlying factor structure in factor portfolio returns. Instead of independently predicting individual anomalies, we focus our attention on the main sources of return variation by isolating the first five principal components (PCs). These PCs capture around $67\\%$ of the variation in factor portfolio returns (see Figure IA.1 in the Internet Appendix), allowing us to greatly reduce the dimensions of the problem at the expense of little return variation foregone. Since the dominant PCs capture common variation in the underlying risk premia, being able to accurately predict their performance leads to the detection of robust predictive patterns across individual anomalies.3 In addition, PCs are not just statistical factors but have an investable interpretation as well. As each PC is a linear combination of the underlying variables, PC portfolios are portfolios of factor portfolios, meaning that their returns and characteristics are calculable. To construct the PC portfolios, we use conventional principal component analysis (PCA), as well as the risk premium PCA (RPPCA) proposed by Lettau and Pelger (2020a). Unlike PCA, RPPCA utilizes information of the mean returns of the factor portfolios in addition to their variances and leads to the extraction of factors that may explain a smaller part of the time-series variation but are important in pricing the cross-section. The resulting PCs have higher Sharpe ratios and in our context help guide the forecasting study around factor portfolios with higher average returns.",

This observation is interesting because it suggests that as the government sells down its holdings and the banks become more accountable to shareholders, the privatized banks take on more risk. This finding is reinforced by the coefficient of Full, which is consistently negative and significant, indicating that banks that are fully privatized exhibit higher risks than those that are partially privatized. The combined effect of Fraction and Full variables on risk taking, coupled with the finding that the privatized banks had higher risk in the pre-privatization period than in the post-privatization period suggests a nonlinear relationship between government ownership and risk taking.\n\nAt zero private ownership the state bank has higher risk than a 20% partially privatized bank perhaps because a state-owned bank typically takes on maximal regulatory risk in an effort to implement government policy e.g., investing in risky sectors such as Agriculture, even if the risky asset provides a lower expected return than the safe asset. As private ownership rises to a more modest level (of 20%), maximal risk taking induced typically by political expediency is tempered by far more prudent lending practices, thus leading to a reduction in risks. From our analysis, a 20% public–private ownership in the privatized banks seems to be the optimal degree of privatization that minimizes the privatized banks' risk taking. This optimal privatization level ensures conservative and prudential practices that stabilize the banks. But, as private ownership in the bank rises to a much higher level and the managers become more accountable to the private investors who demand higher profitability and higher return, the banks tend to take on more risk. At the full end of the privatization spectrum, risk increases. The implication of our results is that the amount of risk a bank undertakes depends on the bank's current ownership structure, with the relationship between private ownership and risk taking being non-linear and roughly U-shaped (inverted U-shaped between private ownership and z-score).",

The formula for DISPERSION is given by: $$D I S P E R S I O N=\\left(V R1-V R2\\right)^{2}+\\left(V R2-V R3\\right)^{2}+\\left(V R3-V R4\\right)^{2}$$ where VR1, VR2, VR3, and VR4 represent the voting rights of the largest shareholders. The results indicate that a higher WEDGE leads to decreased firm valuation, while the presence of MLSD mitigates this effect by increasing contestability. The Shapley value (SHAPLEY) measures the pivotal role of the controlling owner but does not directly correlate with firm value. DISPERSION reflects the distribution of voting power but its impact on firm value is context-dependent.",

H4 suggests that state Anti-Predatory Lending (APL) restrictions on prepayment penalties weaken this association by limiting the willingness of institutions to offer YSPs.

In comparison, the Merton (1974) approach adds one more step by modelling first the response of equity prices to macrofundamentals and then mapping asset price movements into default probabilities. The former approach is quite intuitive and computationally less demanding. The latter has instead the advantage of relying almost exclusively on forward-looking equity prices. However, it can be considerably more data-intensive. Furthermore, market data may sometimes be noisy indicators of credit risk.\n\nKey formula: The Merton model defines default when a firm's asset value falls below its liability threshold, $V_A < D$, where $V_A$ is the asset value and $D$ is the debt level. The Wilson model expresses default rates as $\\lambda_t = f(X_t)$, where $X_t$ is a vector of macroeconomic variables at time $t$.",

Key formula: The efficient portfolio locus is given by \\[\\min_w w^T\\Sigma w\\text{ subject to }w^T\\mu = \\mu_p,\\ w^T\\mathbf{1} = 1\\], where \\Sigma is the covariance matrix. If \\Sigma changes due to data aggregation methods, the efficient frontier shifts.",

Consequently, entrenched directors who are relatively free of external discipline could provide less effective monitoring, which could lead to excessive levels of CEO compensation.",

Banks have a unique opportunity to arbitrage across short-term tax-exempt and taxable bond markets; that is, they are allowed a deduction for interest paid on CD's while, at the same time, receiving tax-exempt coupon payments. This privilege ensures that short-term municipal yields are normally very near to the after-corporate-tax yield on CD's. But this arbitrage by banks is not always profitable or possible. In order for the deduction for interest expense to be valuable, the bank must have sufficient taxable income and when interest rates are unexpectedly high, bank income is normally reduced. Municipal bonds may also have different inherent default risk than corporate bonds. In one sense municipals have more default risk because the assets of municipal governments are not accessable to bondholders in default. (Normally, default results in a renegotiation of the terms of municipal debt.) In another sense municipals may be less risky because the taxing authority of a municipality may be a more reliable source of cash flows than the assets of firms. Robinson [1960] reports that municipals display about 1.5 times the risk of similarly rated corporate bonds (as measured by the standard deviation of return) for the 1950's.

    "question_context": "The evaluation of the net or balance of Fannie's and Freddie's roles must be made in the larger context of housing policy in the United States. Recall that there are a panoply of policies that encourage housing, including policies that favor home ownership. The percentage of households that own their own homes is seen as an important social indicator. The annually announced figure is an important political event, and trends and comparisons with earlier years are scrutinized carefully. The percentage of households owning their own homes rose throughout the 1990s (except for a dip in 1994), reaching an all-time high of $67.4\\%$ in 2000 (up from $63.9\\%$ in 1990). Also in the 1990s, the goal of extending home ownership deeper into the ranks of ‘“low- and moderate-income'' households became more important. As part of the FHEFSSA, HUD acquired the power to set goals for Fannie and Freddie to extend their mortgage purchase efforts so as to encompass more low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThere is a serious argument for encouraging home ownership: There may well be positive externalities from owning rather than renting. Moral hazard problems between landlord and tenant are eliminated, including issues related to the maintenance of the premises. Although most of the gains from their elimination are internalized by the parties, the improved maintenance has positive externalities for the community. Further, to the extent that homeowners care more about the community (because of the spillover effects for themselves), they may become more involved citizens.

    "question_context_used": "The evaluation of the net or balance of Fannie's and Freddie's roles must be made in the larger context of housing policy in the United States. Recall that there are a panoply of policies that encourage housing, including policies that favor home ownership. The percentage of households that own their own homes is seen as an important social indicator. The annually announced figure is an important political event, and trends and comparisons with earlier years are scrutinized carefully. The percentage of households owning their own homes rose throughout the 1990s (except for a dip in 1994), reaching an all-time high of $67.4\\%$ in 2000 (up from $63.9\\%$ in 1990). Also in the 1990s, the goal of extending home ownership deeper into the ranks of ‘“low- and moderate-income'' households became more important. As part of the FHEFSSA, HUD acquired the power to set goals for Fannie and Freddie to extend their mortgage purchase efforts so as to encompass more low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThere is a serious argument for encouraging home ownership: There may well be positive externalities from owning rather than renting. Moral hazard problems between landlord and tenant are eliminated, including issues related to the maintenance of the premises. Although most of the gains from their elimination are internalized by the parties, the improved maintenance has positive externalities for the community. Further, to the extent that homeowners care more about the community (because of the spillover effects for themselves), they may become more involved citizens. There is an empirical literature that supports these and related notions (Rohe and Stegman, 1994; Rohe and Stewart, 1996; Rossi and Weber, 1996; Green and White, 1997; DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999).",

On methodological grounds, however, their procedure is faulty since no attempt was made to specify the demand function(s). Had they done this, they might then have been in a position to identify the banks' loan offer curves to large and small borrowers. Their failure to do this results in an identification problem in which their ex post magnitudes probably reflect some combination of supply and demand schedules. It has been pointed out, for example, that Bach and Huizenga make the assumption that borrower's loan demand remains substantially the same at loose and tight banks of different asset sizes without much support for such an assumption either on a priori or empirical grounds. The mere segmentation of banks into loose, medium, and tight fails to provide a meaningful test of the discrimination issue. In our opinion it makes little sense to reject a charge of discrimination against small-business borrowers during a period of monetary restraint on the grounds that loose banks increased their loans to large borrowers by percentages far in excess of the increase in loans to small borrowers.",

KVJ’s (2012) identification is based on measuring the impact of changes in Treasury supply on a variety of yield spreads.

The premise that short-term safety and long-term safety are distinct attributes underlies our idea that a shift toward short-term T-bills, holding fixed total government debt, is likely to crowd out short-term borrowing by financial intermediaries. The key insight is that short-term financial paper is a much closer substitute for T-bills than T-bonds. Moreover, while intermediaries cannot create long-term safety, they do compete with the Treasury in supplying short-term safety.

    "question_context": "Merton (1974) presents a model of equity and debt valuation in which financial markets are assumed to be perfect. The model assumes that a firm with initial value $V$ issues a zero-coupon bond with face value $D$ and maturity $T$. Firm value is assumed to be lognormally distributed and trading is continuous. Interest rates, the payout rate and volatility are all assumed constant. The firm is assumed to follow a pattern of rational default. That is, default occurs at the maturity of the discount debt if $V<D$, which means that equity is an option on firm value that pays $\\mathbf{Max}(V-D,0)$ at time $T$. Under the condition of risk-free debt and costless bankruptcy, the Black and Scholes (1973) formula gives the value of equity of the firm, S. Here, $S$ increases with (1) an increase in value of the firm’s assets, $V$, (2) an increase in the variance of the value of the firm’s assets and (3) an increase in the time to maturity of the amount of debt $D$. The value of the debt, $D$, is equal to firm value minus the value of equity. With respect to the value of the firm, firm value is completely independent of the type of financing used for its projects. That is, the Modigliani–Miller proposition of leverage irrelevance holds. The upshot of Merton’s model is that for a given firm: $$\\sigma_{S}=(V S_{V}/S)\\times\\sigma_{V},$$ where $\\sigma$ denotes the standard deviation of the rate of return, $S_{V}$ is the derivative of equity value with respect to firm value (i.e., the call option’s delta) and $V$ and $S$ represent the market values of the firm and equity respectively. Options delta values range from 0 to 1. Options delta values rise as options get more and more in-the-money and reduce as the options get more and more out-of-the-money. With $S_{V}=1$, (1) reduces to $$\\sigma_{S}=(1+L R)\\times\\sigma_{V},$$ where $L R=D/S$ is the market financial ratio. Equation (2) makes clear that as the value of equity increases, the firm becomes less levered and as a result, the volatility of equity falls.

This suggests that U.S. banks hold buffer stocks of liquid assets when expanding risky, illiquid credit activities to pre-empt liquidity disruptions. For large European banks, the same ratio positively impacts commercial lending growth but negatively affects retail lending growth, highlighting their ability to curtail retail lending amid asset-shrinking pressures. Additionally, the ratio of available stable funding focusing on Core deposits negatively impacts retail lending growth for large U.S. banks, while it positively affects commercial lending growth for small U.S. banks. However, the ratio of available stable funding to total assets is insignificant for European banks, emphasizing the role of funding structure in lending behavior during the post-2008 credit crunch.",

The motivation for random field model of the term structure stems from two different perspectives: First, although the frameworks of Ho and Lee (1986) and of Heath, Jarrow,and Morton (1990,1992) permit interest rate models to be consistent with the current term structure, it is necessary to continuously recalibrate these models to maintain consistency.

To minimize total costs, the insurer should audit to the extent that the expected marginal costs of auditing are just equal to the expected marginal savings from auditing. An important realization is that the savings from audits are not just the savings in claims costs from detecting built-up claims. Additional savings will be due to the deterrence of buildup that occurs when claimants know that claims are being audited. Under ideal conditions, the optimal auditing strategy will completely eliminate buildup, and thus all savings will stem from deterrence. Under more realistic conditions, the optimal auditing strategy will serve partly as a deterrent and partly to identify those claims that are fraudulent or built up.

Currently, VA providers charge a time-invariant base fee to recover expenses, but high acquisition costs and frequent lapses make this model unsustainable. The new structure moderately front-loads fees, discouraging lapses and allowing overall fee reduction. Key formula: The optimal fee reduction can lower the insurer’s average annual expenses by up to 35% (8% of the single premium) in competitive markets, while innovative providers may gain a surplus of around 6% of the purchase premium. This structure is easy to implement, benefits both policyholders and insurers, and does not complicate hedging.

    "question_context_used": "The proposed time-dependent fee structure for variable annuities (VAs) aims to address high fees and frequent policy lapses. Currently, VA providers charge a time-invariant base fee to recover expenses, but high acquisition costs and frequent lapses make this model unsustainable. The new structure moderately front-loads fees, discouraging lapses and allowing overall fee reduction. Key formula: The optimal fee reduction can lower the insurer’s average annual expenses by up to 35% (8% of the single premium) in competitive markets, while innovative providers may gain a surplus of around 6% of the purchase premium. This structure is easy to implement, benefits both policyholders and insurers, and does not complicate hedging. It contrasts with state-dependent fees, which create inequities and manipulation risks, and ratchet guarantees, which are harder to hedge due to volatility sensitivity.",

Thus the higher the reputation of the private equity firm, the more likely that shareholders will commit to the deal, especially in PTPs involving MBOs. The above arguments also apply to MBIs. Therefore, for MBOs and MBIs, the higher the reputation of the private equity provider, the greater the irrevocable commitments. Hence: H5: There is a positive relationship between the reputation of the private equity firm supporting a PTP and the extent of irrevocable commitments. Evidence of higher board shareholdings in firms going private was found by Maupin (1987) and Halpern et al. (1999). An MBO’s irrevocable commitments will normally include all or most of the current management’s shareholdings in addition to any external backing they may receive. Therefore as board ownership increases, irrevocable commitments will also increase. Although there is an inherent conflict of interest between institutional shareholders and managers in an MBO bid, it is likely that significant board ownership will encourage other shareholders to back the bid to go private since a board shareholding that is sufficiently large may make an opposing bid unlikely (Song and Walkling, 1993). Thus, for MBOs, we expect that the higher the board shareholdings, the higher the irrevocable commitments. Hence: H6a: There is a positive relationship between board shareholdings in PTP MBOs and the extent of irrevocable commitments.",

In our context, we cannot imagine reasons for reverse causality, because an enforcement action is not enacted in response to the structure of a specific loan's syndicate. Identifying the causal effect of an enforcement action on syndicate structure can be impeded, however, by omitted variables that the syndicate structure of post-enforcement loans could capture erroneously. Such omitted-variable bias could lead to two alternative explanations of the findings. First, from a supply-side viewpoint, enforcement actions are not exogenous to the business model of banks. The types of enforcement actions especially considered in our paper are a treatment for important safety and soundness problems incurred by banks in the pre-treatment period. Post-treatment, the punished banks ought to move to a more prudent risk equilibrium, thus restructuring their lending and their loan shares. Similarly, our results might be due to heightened supervisory scrutiny, which limits the ability of punished banks to continue their lending operations as in the pre-enforcement period. Second, from a demand-side viewpoint, an enforcement action could lead to lower demand for credit by firms from the punished bank and this might be especially true during the crisis.

The monitoring index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher monitoring index values implying greater firm monitoring and agency problems.",

Mortgages are contingent claims contracts in which the mortgage value $(V^{M})$ depends critically on two stochastic processes, the market interest rate, $r(t)$, and the house value, $H(t)$.

We analyse several alternative strategies for banks to cover the funding gaps and find that, in all cases, the outcome is inferior to the status quo either in terms of price or stability of funding. We also identify multiple channels through which the effects from the introduction of the CBDC may propagate from banks to the other sectors of the economy. When the banking sector chooses to liquidate debt securities, corporate bonds may suffer a significant drop in prices, causing funding difficulties for non-financial corporations. Differently, in the case in which the commercial banks decide to redeem loans, households may experience significant funding constraints. Finally, by invoking network centrality measures, we observe changes in the relative importance of the individual nodes of the network (the institutional sectors). In this way, by changing the shape of the macro-network, the introduction of a digital currency may also affect the network’s stability properties. Our findings therefore also support the view that the introduction of digital currencies should take into account wider effects than merely the immediate counterparty exposures. We then extend our framework to the case of the stablecoin, a digital currency issued by the private sector, either domestic or foreign. The introduction of a stablecoin enhances the relevance of the private issuing sector in the macro-network and generates different relative price adjustments in the markets for financial assets.

    ],
    "question_context": "The discretionary access to cash allows managers to avoid immediate default by burning through cash in case of economic distress, and, therefore, to extend the period they obtain their fixed income. This use of cash as a buffer against bankruptcy induces them to target excess cash, i.e., a cash level beyond the target $L^{S H}$ of equityholders, due to the self-preservation motive. Managers trade off the positive impact of excess cash on the value of their fixed income against the negative effect on the value of their equity compensation when determining the target cash policy $L^{*}$ in System (14). Table A-2 describes the excess cash policy choice and its determinants. Besides the excess cash ratios $((L^{*}-L^{S H})/V)$ in Column three, the table also reports shareholder wealth maximizing cash ratios $(L^{S H}/V)$ and corporate cash ratios $(L^{*}/V)$. All cash ratios are calculated for the coupon that is optimal with $L^{*}$. In the baseline parameter specification, the excess cash ratio targeted by managers corresponds to $1.82\\%$. Hence, $L^{*}/V=11.04\\%$ is about $20\\%$ above $L^{S H}/V=9.22\\%$.\n\nTable A-1 of Section 4.2 shows that the marginal impact of cash on the default risk is larger for a higher yield on cash-like securities (l). Hence, managers in a high l firm have a higher propensity for excess cash to increase the value of their fixed income, i.e., a stronger self-preservation motive, than in a low l firm. At the same time, excess cash has a weaker negative effect on the value of the equity compensation if l is larger due to the lower opportunity costs of holding cash given by r-l. These insights explain the finding in lines six and seven of Table A-2 that managers hold more excess cash for a higher l. According to Table A-1 of Section 4.2, the self-preservation motive of managers is stronger for higher distress costs $\\rho$. Additionally, the impact of excess cash on the equity part of the compensation is only moderately affected by this parameter.

    "question_context_used": "The discretionary access to cash allows managers to avoid immediate default by burning through cash in case of economic distress, and, therefore, to extend the period they obtain their fixed income. This use of cash as a buffer against bankruptcy induces them to target excess cash, i.e., a cash level beyond the target $L^{S H}$ of equityholders, due to the self-preservation motive. Managers trade off the positive impact of excess cash on the value of their fixed income against the negative effect on the value of their equity compensation when determining the target cash policy $L^{*}$ in System (14). Table A-2 describes the excess cash policy choice and its determinants. Besides the excess cash ratios $((L^{*}-L^{S H})/V)$ in Column three, the table also reports shareholder wealth maximizing cash ratios $(L^{S H}/V)$ and corporate cash ratios $(L^{*}/V)$. All cash ratios are calculated for the coupon that is optimal with $L^{*}$. In the baseline parameter specification, the excess cash ratio targeted by managers corresponds to $1.82\\%$. Hence, $L^{*}/V=11.04\\%$ is about $20\\%$ above $L^{S H}/V=9.22\\%$.\n\nTable A-1 of Section 4.2 shows that the marginal impact of cash on the default risk is larger for a higher yield on cash-like securities (l). Hence, managers in a high l firm have a higher propensity for excess cash to increase the value of their fixed income, i.e., a stronger self-preservation motive, than in a low l firm. At the same time, excess cash has a weaker negative effect on the value of the equity compensation if l is larger due to the lower opportunity costs of holding cash given by r-l. These insights explain the finding in lines six and seven of Table A-2 that managers hold more excess cash for a higher l. According to Table A-1 of Section 4.2, the self-preservation motive of managers is stronger for higher distress costs $\\rho$. Additionally, the impact of excess cash on the equity part of the compensation is only moderately affected by this parameter. Hence, managers target more excess cash in the trade-off of System (14) when $\\rho$ is larger (see lines eight and nine of Table A-2).",

Specifically, large firms tend to have larger exposures to the Canadian Dollar and Euro, but smaller (more negative) exposures to the Japanese Yen. The formula $5.6\\%(13.2\\%)$ illustrates the percentage of sample firms with significant exposures based on earnings (stock prices) at a one-month horizon.",

Normally, there are 12 specific levels in the ranking system of civil service in China. Based on the ranking system, we construct a dummy variable Political Connection a, which is equal to 1 if the political connected officer’s rank is higher or equal to 6, and 0 otherwise. A second measure of CEOs’ political connections commonly used in China is the category of government agencies the CEOs’ political connected officers hold or held positions at, measured by how much economic resources the certain government agencies can manage. The dummy variable Political Connection b is introduced. If a CEO’s political connected officer works at an agency with above $75\\%$ quantile of the number of approval rights in our sample, this variable is equal to 1; otherwise, it is 0. The CPPCC position status of a CEO is also an excellent index to denote the CEO’s political connection. Therefore, we have a dummy variable Political Connection c equaling to 1 when a CEO is a deputy member of CPPCC, and 0 otherwise. The last measure we adopt in this paper for a CEO’s political connection is the rank of People’s Congress that a CEO is elected as a deputy to a People’s Congress is the highest organization of state power in China. According to this logic, we use Political Connection d to measure a CEO’s political connection, which is equal to 1 if the CEO is elected as a deputy to a People’s Congress above prefecturelevel, and 0 otherwise.",

    "question_context": "Key formula: The fixed price of housing is given by $P_{0}(r)=c-C(r)$, where $c\\equiv C(\\overline{{{r}}})+G(\\overline{{{r}}})$ represents the fixed costs of commuting and governmental fees. This capitalization ensures that households with each income $y_{i}$ have a constant net income $y_{i}-c$ at all radial distances $r$. The condition $C^{\\prime}+P_{0}^{\\prime}=0$ must hold everywhere to ensure that residents within any interval can be distinguished purely by income, without requiring different family sizes.

Thus, the value of the economic rents from the possibility of redevelopment decreases. When the developers’ market is competitive, this decrease will be completely borne by the landowners, deterring the landowners’ initial development activities.

Under SFAS Number 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, tax expense is composed of the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Deferred taxes represent taxes that will be paid or refunded in the future as a result of timing book-tax differences. These timing differences are an effective and popular tax planning tool to reduce current taxes and maximize the time value of money. However, from a financial statement perspective, this can be offset by the inclusion of the deferred tax component. GAAPETR includes both current and deferred taxes and will not reflect short-term tax avoidance, a valuable performance and cash management tool. To allay the issues with GAAP ETR, Dyreng et al.

Moreover, unlike GAAP ETR, cash ETR is not affected by changes in estimates such as the valuation allowance and tax cushions. Following Dyreng et al. (2008) we measure cash taxes as follows: $$C a s h E T R_{i,t}=C a s h T a x e s P a i d_{i,t}/\\left(P r e t a x I n c o m e_{i,t}-S p e c i a l I t e m s_{i,t}\\right)$$.",

Under SFAS Number 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, tax expense is composed of the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Deferred taxes represent taxes that will be paid or refunded in the future as a result of timing book-tax differences. These timing differences are an effective and popular tax planning tool to reduce current taxes and maximize the time value of money. However, from a financial statement perspective, this can be offset by the inclusion of the deferred tax component. GAAPETR includes both current and deferred taxes and will not reflect short-term tax avoidance, a valuable performance and cash management tool. To allay the issues with GAAP ETR, Dyreng et al.

If $x<y,$, then the decision maker experiences disutility from having forgone the possibility of doing better by having chosen the foregone alternative.

This means that when large amounts of insurance are predicted by EUT, a regret-averse individual (i.e., an individual with regret-theoretical preferences) should choose less insurance, and when small amounts of insurance are predicted to be optimal by EUT, the regretaverse individual prefers to purchase more insurance.

The mean number of trading days in the announcement interval is fifty-one, and the standard deviation is twenty-six. A possible cause of time-series variation in beta estimates is variation in the frequency with which the securities are traded, for it is well known that infrequent trading and the resulting nonsynchronicity of price observations create a downward bias in the estimates. To allow for this possibility, Scholes-Williams [7]-type betas were also calculated by summing the coefficients from three market-model regressions in which the market return is contemporaneous, lagged one day, and anticipated one day. The five-day estimator employs leads and lags of two days and provides consistent estimates even if the security does not trade every day. Table I reports the mean beta estimate for each of the three time intervals using the three different estimators. The results for the three different estimators are similar.

    "question_context_used": "The standard market-model regression for stock $j$ is given by: \n\n$$ R_{j t}=a_{j}+b_{j}R_{m j t}+e_{j t}. $$ \n\nThe first interval is the period between the split announcement and the date it becomes effective, which we call the 'announcement interval.' The mean number of trading days in the announcement interval is fifty-one, and the standard deviation is twenty-six. A possible cause of time-series variation in beta estimates is variation in the frequency with which the securities are traded, for it is well known that infrequent trading and the resulting nonsynchronicity of price observations create a downward bias in the estimates. To allow for this possibility, Scholes-Williams [7]-type betas were also calculated by summing the coefficients from three market-model regressions in which the market return is contemporaneous, lagged one day, and anticipated one day. The five-day estimator employs leads and lags of two days and provides consistent estimates even if the security does not trade every day. Table I reports the mean beta estimate for each of the three time intervals using the three different estimators. The results for the three different estimators are similar. There is no significant change in the mean beta estimate between the pre-announcement interval and the announcement interval. However, there is an increase of over twenty percent in the average estimate after the effective date of the split.",
