Konishi (1978, Lemma; 1979a, Theorems 2.1 and 2.2; 1979b, Theorem 6.2) provided the Edgeworth expansions of the distribution of the function of the sample correlation matrix up to order $n^{-1}$ under normality. The normality assumption has been relaxed by some authors. Boik (1998, Eq. (19)) derived the matrix expression of the asymptotic biases of order $n^{-1}$ for the vectorized sample correlation matrix under nonnormality while Ogasawara (2004a, Eq. (A11)) gave the corresponding elementwise result which is convenient for actual computation. Kollo and Ruul (2003, Theorem 4) provided the Edgeworth expansion of the vectorized sample correlation matrix up to order $\\bar{n}^{-1/2}$ with the matrix expression of the associated cumulants up to the third order under nonnormality. The purpose of this paper is to have the Edgeworth expansion of $r_{a b}$ under nonnormality up to order $n^{-1}$ and to illustrate their results with comparison to the corresponding simulated distributions. It will be shown that the asymptotic expansion will improve the approximation to the true distribution with moderate sample sizes.
