    "question": "The Birnbaum–Saunders distribution is receiving considerable attention due to its good properties. One of its extensions is the class of scale-mixture Birnbaum–Saunders (SBS) distributions, which shares its good properties, but it also has further properties. The autoregressive conditional duration models are the primary family used for analyzing high-frequency financial data. We propose a methodology based on SBS autoregressive conditional duration models, which includes in-sample inference, goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecast techniques. We carry out a Monte Carlo study to evaluate its performance and assess its practical usefulness with real-world data of financial transactions from the New York stock exchange. The main objective of this work is to propose a methodology based on ACD models generated from SBS distributions (SBS–ACD models). This methodology includes in-sample techniques considering estimation of the model parameters via the [BLANK] algorithm, inference about these parameters and model checking based on residual analysis, and out-of-sample forecast techniques.",

This results in an estimator that combines nonparametric quantile regression and extreme value theory (EVT). The POT method approximates large observations that exceed a high threshold reasonably well by the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) with distribution function G_ξ,β(x). The shape parameter ξ and scale parameter β > 0 of the GPD can be consistently estimated if the threshold exceedances are independent, regardless of the true underlying distribution. The support of the GPD is x ≥ 0 when ξ ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ x ≤ -β/ξ if ξ < 0.

The parameters η, δ, ξ, and λ are to be determined from the first four moments of an observed distribution. For distributions not too far from normality, the problem reduces to determining ω and Ω from given values of β₁ and γ₂, where ω = e^(1/δ²) and Ω = η/δ. If the distribution is symmetrical about the origin, then β₁ = 0, implying Ω = 0, and γ₂ can be expressed in terms of ω as γ₂ = (1/8)(ω⁴ - 1)(ω⁴ + 3). Solving for ω gives ω = {√(4 + 2γ₂) - 1}^(1/2) = {√(2β₂ - 2) - 1}^(1/2). What is the value of ω when γ₂ = 0?",

The classical estimative method, in contrast, uses q(y|x) = p{y|θ=θ^(x)}, where θ^(x) is some efficient estimate of θ. A goodness-of-fit criterion based on an information measure introduced by Aitchison (1975) evaluates the deviation of an estimate r(y|x) from the true density p(y|θ) as ∫X p′(x|θ)dx ∫Y p(y|θ)log{p(y|θ)/r(y|x)}dy. For the multivariate normal case, the predictive method based on vague prior knowledge is shown to be superior to the estimative method, leading to the estimate q(y|x) = St_d{ν, m, (1+1/n)S}, where St_d denotes a d-dimensional Student's t distribution.

    "question": "In the context of nonlinear regression models with heteroscedasticity, the general form of the model is given by Y_i = f(x_i, β) + ε_i, where ε_i ~ N(0, σ_i^2). To model the variance σ_i^2, the equation σ_i^2 = σ^2 m(z_i, λ) = σ^2 m_i is used. The test for heterogeneity of variance is equivalent to testing the hypotheses H_0: λ = λ_0 vs. H_1: λ ≠ λ_0. The log-likelihood function for θ = (λ^T, β^T, σ^2)^T is given by l(θ) = C - (n/2)logσ^2 - (1/2)Σ_{i=1}^n log m_i - (1/(2σ^2))Σ_{i=1}^n m_i^{-1}(Y_i - f(x_i, β))^2. The Fisher information matrix under H_0 is I_Y(θ) = [ (1/2)M^T M^{-2} M 0 (1/(2σ^2))M^T M^{-1} 1_n; 0 (1/σ^2)F^T M^{-1} F 0; (1/(2σ^2))1_n^T M^{-1} M 0 n/(2σ^4) ], where M = diag(m_1, ..., m_n), Ṁ = (∂m(z_i, λ)/∂λ_j)_{n×q}, 1_n = (1, ..., 1)^T, and Ḟ = (∂f(x_i, β)/∂β_j)_{n×p}. The score test statistic for hypothesis (2) is based on the score function ∂l(θ)/∂λ|_{θ̂_0} = { Ṁ^T u / (2σ^2) }|_{θ̂_0}, where u = (ε_1^2, ..., ε_n^2)^T, θ̂_0 = (λ_0^T, γ̂_0^T)^T, γ̂_0 is the MLE of γ under H_0, and Ṁ = (I_n - 1_n 1_n^T /n) Ṁ. The score statistic is computed as SC_1 = { (∂l(θ)/∂λ)^T I^{λλ} (∂l(θ)/∂λ) }|_{θ̂_0} = { u^T Ṁ (Ṁ^T Ṁ)^{-1} Ṁ^T u / (2σ^4) }|_{θ̂_0}, where I^{λλ} = 2 { Ṁ^T (I_n - 1_n 1_n^T /n) Ṁ }^{-1} = 2 (Ṁ^T Ṁ)^{-1}, which is the upper left corner of I_Y^{-1}(θ) under H_0. The asymptotic distribution of SC_1 under H_0 is a central χ^2 distribution with q degrees of freedom. The approximate power of the score test under local alternatives is given by ALP_1(λ) = 1 - F_χ^2(χ_α^2(q) | q, δ), where F_χ^2(x | q, δ) is the noncentral χ^2 distribution function with q degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter δ = μ^T Σ^{-1} μ, with μ = (σ^2 / (2σ_0^2)) Ṁ_0^T M 1_n + (1 / (2σ_0^2)) Ṁ_0^T G 1_n and Σ = (σ^4 / (2σ_0^4)) Ṁ_0^T M^2 Ṁ_0 + (σ^2 / σ_0^4) Ṁ_0^T M G Ṁ_0. Here, χ_α^2(q) is the critical value of the central χ^2 distribution with q degrees of freedom at level α, Ṁ_0 is the value of Ṁ at λ_0, and Ṁ = (I_n - 1_n 1_n^T /n) Ṁ. The noncentrality parameter δ is crucial for calculating the approximate power under local alternatives. What is the expression for the noncentrality parameter δ in terms of μ and Σ?",
