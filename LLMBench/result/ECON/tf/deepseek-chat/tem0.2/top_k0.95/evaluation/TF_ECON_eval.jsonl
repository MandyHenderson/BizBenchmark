To isolate these exposure effects, they use parental age of arrival as an instrument for parental language fluency, arguing that those parents who arrived at a young age learn the host-country language more easily. As this variable may work on their children's language proficiency through channels other than parental language proficiency, they use for identification the interaction of this variable with non-English speaking country of origin. This identification strategy therefore assumes the same nonlanguagerelated age of arrival effects for children of immigrants from English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries. <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> Our approach makes use of the background characteristics that we have available in our survey data. Instead of using an instrumental variable type approach, we make a “selection on observables” assumption, by conditioning on different sets of factors that may lead to confounding the effect of parental language on the offspring's language proficiency, and cultural and environmental factors (see Angrist and Krueger 1999 for discussion). The parameter we estimate is the change in the conditional expectation of the child's language proficiency $(L^{c})$ if parental proficiency $(L^{p})$ changes, conditional on a set of background variables $\\pmb{X}:\\frac{\\partial E(L^{c}|L^{p},\\pmb{\\hat{X}})}{\\partial L^{p}}$ To the extent that the set of conditioning variables eliminates the correlation of child's language proficiency with parental language proficiency through any other confounding channels of the type we have discussed above, this measures the exposure effect. Notice that as our conditioning variables contain measures of parental permanent earnings, the mechanism that creates intergenerational mobility in the Becker-Tomes model is eliminated. <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> We implement this strategy by estimating regressions of the following form: <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> $$ L_{i}^{c}=a_{1}+\\Theta L_{i}^{p}+X_{i}{'}\\thinspace\\alpha+\\nu_{i}. $$ <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> Thevariables $L_{i}^{c}$ and $L_{i}^{p}$ are measures of language proficiency, and we discuss their construction below. The vector of conditioning variables $X_{i}$ includes family and background characteristics that take account of confounding factors of the sort discussed above. One such factor may be related to origin of the parent, as different home country languages may be more or less distant from the host-country language. Origin dummies (measured as origin country of the father) also pick up ethnic capital (see Borjas 1992) and networking differences across groups.2 Correlation in genetic endowment may lead to a positive correlation between parental language proficiency and the child's language proficiency. We condition on parental education, as well as a permanent measure of father's earnings.? Exposure of the child to the host-country language may further depend on the extent to which parents are integrated in the host-country society and labor market, as well as their social context.

Measurement of Language Proficiency <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> Akey issue is measurement of thevariables $L_{i}^{c}$ and $L_{i}^{p}$ . In our data, both are selfreported. Self-reported data on language proficiency suffer from measurement error. While this leads only to a loss in efficiency where the child's language measure is concerned, mismeasurement in parental language ability leads (as long as the measurement error is classical and ignoring correlations with the other regressors) to an attenuation bias in the parameter 0. Recent work by Dustmann and van Soest (2001) suggests that measurement error in language ability may lead to a downward bias by up to a factor of three in estimation equations that regress log wages on self-reported language measures. This finding is supported by evidence provided in Bleakley and Chin (2004). <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> We address the measurement error problem by making use of the repeated information we have on parental language proficiency to reduce the noise in our data. We construct a time-averaged fixed measure of language proficiency for the individuals in our sample. We do this by estimating fixed effects language equations of the followingform: <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> $$ y_{i t}=b_{0}+a g e_{i t}b_{1}+a g e_{i t}{}^{2}b_{2}+u_{i}+e_{i t}, $$ <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> where $y_{i t}$ is a measure of language proficiency for individual $i$ in period t, age is the individual's age, $e_{i t}$ is an idiosyncratic error term, and $\\pmb{u}_{i}$ is an individual specific fixed effect. <PARAGRAPH_SEPARATOR> Our measure for an individual's language proficiency is then the prediction $\\hat{b_{0}}+a g e_{i}\\hat{b_{1}}+a g e_{i}^{2}\\hat{b_{2}}+\\hat{u_{i}}$ evaluated at the parent's age when the child was ten years old.4 Age ten is chosen here as this is the age that the secondary-school track choice is made in Germany, and therefore a critical point in the child's future education and labor market outcomes. We use the same estimation method to predict the language proficiency of the child (using child's age), where again we predict proficiency at age ten. Notice that choosing another age would not affect the estimates as it does not affectthevariationin thisvariable acrossindividuals.The coefficientestimatesfor $b_{0},b_{1},b_{2}$ will be unbiased and consistent as the number of individuals grows large. Theestimate $\\hat{\\pmb{u}_{i}}$ , though unbiased, will be consistent only as the number of periods grows large.
