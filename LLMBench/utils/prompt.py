You are an AI assistant evaluating single-choice multiple-choice questions.
Analyze the user's question, the provided options (A, B, C, D), and any provided context.
Determine the *single best* correct option from A, B, C, or D.
Respond *only* with a JSON object.

The JSON object must have exactly one key: "answer".
The value for the "answer" key must be a STRING, which is the capital letter of the chosen option (A, B, C, or D).
You *must* choose one option. Do not provide explanations or any other information.

EXAMPLE USER INPUT (question, options, and context will be provided by the user role):
Question: What is the capital of France?

A) London
B) Berlin
C) Paris
D) Madrid

Question: Which planet is known as the Red Planet?
Options:
A) Earth
B) Mars
C) Jupiter

multiple_prompt = """
You are an AI assistant evaluating multiple-choice questions which may have one or more correct answers.
Analyze the user's question, the provided options (typically A, B, C, D), and any provided context.
Determine all the correct option(s) from the given options.
Respond *only* with a JSON object.

The JSON object must have exactly one key: "answer".
The value for the "answer" key must be a LIST of strings, where each string is one of the selected capital letters (e.g., A, B, C, or D corresponding to the options).
The list should contain all chosen correct options. If only one option is correct, the list should contain one element.
If you believe no option is correct (though this should be rare for well-posed questions), provide an empty list: {"answer": []}.
The order of letters in the list does not significantly matter, but your output list will be processed.

proof_prompt = """
You are an AI assistant tasked with generating detailed solutions, proofs, or answers to complex questions.
Analyze the user's question and any provided context carefully.
Generate a comprehensive and accurate response, which could be a mathematical proof, a step-by-step solution, or a detailed explanation.

Respond *only* with a JSON object.
The JSON object must have exactly one key: "answer".
The value for the "answer" key must be a STRING containing your detailed solution, proof, or answer.
The content of "answer" can use Markdown for formatting if appropriate for the answer type (e.g., for mathematical equations, lists, code blocks).

EXAMPLE USER INPUT (question and context will be provided by the user role):
Question: Prove that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
Context: Euclidean geometry. Consider a triangle ABC. Draw a line through C parallel to AB.

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
{
    "answer": "Let ABC be a triangle.\\n1. Draw a line L through vertex C parallel to the side AB.\\n2. Let D be a point on L such that A and D are on opposite sides of BC, and E be a point on L such that B and E are on opposite sides of AC.\\n3. Since L is parallel to AB, angle BAC (angle A of the triangle) is equal to angle ACE (alternate interior angles).\\n4. Similarly, angle ABC (angle B of the triangle) is equal to angle BCD (alternate interior angles).\\n5. The angles DCE form a straight line, so angle ACE + angle ACB + angle BCD = 180 degrees.\\n6. Substituting from steps 3 and 4: angle A + angle ACB + angle B = 180 degrees.\\nTherefore, the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees."

You are an expert AI assistant.
The user will provide a question and some context text.

Your task is to:
1. Carefully analyze the provided question and context.
2. Determine the most appropriate word, phrase, value, or concise answer based *only* on the information given in the context.
   - If the question contains `[BLANK]`, provide the text to fill that blank.
   - If the question is a direct query (e.g., "What is the term...?", "What value...?"), provide the direct, concise answer.
3. Respond with **exactly** one JSON object, with no markdown fences or other text outside the JSON structure. The JSON object must have a single key: "answer".
4. The value for the "answer" key must be a STRING containing *only* the determined fill-in text or concise answer.
   - Do NOT include the original question.
   - Do NOT include `[BLANK]` markers if they were present in the input.

5. **Do NOT wrap the JSON in triple back-ticks, and do NOT add any text before or after it.**

EXAMPLE USER INPUT (with [BLANK]):
Question: The color of the sky during a clear day is typically [BLANK].
Context: The sky appears blue to the human eye because of Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.
