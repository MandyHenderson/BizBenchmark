    "question": "4) Calculate the implied valuation of Intensity Therapeutics' IPO given that it was upsized and oversubscribed at the top of the range, assuming a raise of over $20 million.",
    "gold_answer": "If the IPO was upsized and oversubscribed at the top of the range with a raise exceeding $20 million, the implied valuation would depend on the number of shares offered and the price per share. For example, if 10 million shares were offered at $2 per share, the valuation would be $20 million. Exact figures would require the final prospectus details.",
    "question_context": "Good morning, and welcome to the Intensity Therapeutics' Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.\nAs a reminder, this conference call contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe information presented today is time-sensitive and is accurate only as the date of this call, August 14, 2023. If any portion of this call is being rebroadcast, retransmitted, or redistributed at a later date, Intensity Therapeutics will not be reviewing or updating this material.\nOn today's call, we plan to review our financials for the quarter, discuss the origins of our novel technology, explain the science behind our locally delivered drug, and why our product candidate has the potential to succeed in metastatic disease, such as sarcoma, as well as local disease in areas, such as breast cancer.\nI shall also discuss our programs to treat sarcoma and early-stage breast cancer, review our quarterly business results, provide details into our current development activities. And our objective today, really, is to explain how our lead drug, INT230-6, could be a very new weapon in the war on cancer.\nNow, as everyone knows, the financing environment for healthcare has been and continues to be challenging. I believe that, there have been only seven biotech IPOs with a raise of over $20 million so far in 2023. And that being said, I believe investors will respond to data, and the data that we presented in Q2 at ASCO was strong.\nAnd as a result, we were able to complete an upsized oversubscribed IPO at the top of the range. I'm very excited by that, I'm even more relieved that we were able to do it.\n\nIntensity Therapeutics held its second quarter 2023 conference call to discuss financial results and operational updates. The call included forward-looking statements and detailed the company's novel technology and drug candidate INT230-6."

    "question": "1) Quantitatively, if Canapi Ventures' second fund has $\\$800$ million in dry powder and targets 20 investments, what is the average check size per investment, and how does this compare to the fund's historical average?",
    "gold_answer": "Average check size:\n- Dry powder = $\\$800$ million\n- Target investments = 20\n- Average check size = $\\$800$ million / 20 = $\\$40$ million per investment.\n\nHistorical comparison not provided, but typical early-stage fund checks range $\\$5$-$\\$50$ million.",
    "question_context": "Yeah, I think, the mix feels about right. You could make a case that we find more SBA opportunity, I think you could make a case to the contrary. Right now, it feels like the balance and the mix is about what we're seeing. And we'll continue to, as we look at pipelines. I think, one of the areas that we think there's going to be some opportunity. Obviously, we're not in, as we mentioned. The office sort of commercial real estate space, but there are places that are the secondary and tertiary, where some people paint real estate with a giant brush. And so maybe that senior housing maybe that self-storage places that fall into a real estate bucket. We look at the much more as operating businesses, where we may find some incremental opportunities as folks pullback broadly speaking from real estate. So we're just going to be an opportunistic right, now and we'll take what comes.\nI would say that, the guys at Canapi are still looking at three to five new opportunities, a day. That said, somebody said earlier that, those valuations of those businesses have dropped dramatically from 20 times forward revenues, to six. And I would say that, most of these companies are looking to trim overhead, and get the profitability on their own. So we're being very circumspect, but are tickled to death that our second fund is in the process of wrapping up. So we have about 800 plus million dollars of dry powder to pick the winners. So, so far so good.\n\nDiscussion on lending mix stability, opportunities in secondary real estate markets, and Canapi Ventures' investment approach."

    "question_context": "So net-net, we view it very much as a timing thing and it's not going to impact us in 2015 negatively, but it did cause some issues obviously in Q3 and Q4 this year.\nAnd so – and just trying to reconcile, I'd inferred from your prior guidance of $475 million of operating revenue that you were targeting roughly $340 million of eDiscovery revenue, and now I'm hearing something more like $300 million. So there'd be about $40 million shortfall. So we had the $15 million to $20 million deferral and with – and you said volumes were strong, so would the rest be pricing?\nIt would be. I think the volumes, particularly in the US, we continue to see good margins, good pricing and, of course, margins throughout international with some expansion in international. But in the US is where we're experiencing the most price pressure and that is relating to the top line. So when you see those larger volumes and record volumes in various aspects of the business in electronic discovery, but with lesser revenues, there is a strong correlation in the US to pricing.\nThat's why we've significantly picked up the pace relative to some cost reductions. We've talked about some consolidation factors, but we've really focused on some of the cost aspects, so that we can work on the margin domestically, recognizing that there has been pricing pressure. And I think it's safe to say that everybody in the industry experiences that kind of pricing pressure, so it's not something unique with us.\nOn the other hand, I think we can address it, as we've discussed, and we are very pleased, going back to the international business, that we do have very good margins there. We don't have some of the challenges internationally that we've discussed here in the domestic market. And Brad indicated, Hong Kong is having a record performance, Japan is really picking up. Toronto, we'll see a very good year next year. We're doing more and more on the mainland now out of London, companies like – or countries like Germany, for example, et cetera. We're looking at other locations to open. We want to do that very selectively, but there are a couple of additional markets that we'll probably move into in the near future. But I think the global part of that business is going to be a more significant portion of the overall eDiscovery operation. It's up to 26% most recently. And we think it certainly has potential to grow from there, and that does have some advantages. And I think from a competitive point of view, we are extremely well-positioned and should be able to pick up some more market share.\nAll right. Last question and then I'll get back in the queue. But just as regards your preliminary discussion of 2015, if we look at 10% to 15% growth in eDiscovery, recovering that $15 million to $20 million of deferral would be 6% or 7% . So in terms of how we're thinking about it, are we thinking about maybe volumes being up 25% and pricing being down 10% to 15% plus the deferral gets us to roughly mid-teens total revenue growth, is that roughly fair of how the pieces fit together?\nYeah. We usually don't go into that level of detail, but on a very top line kind of basis, Adam or Brad – Adam, do you any comments on that, just kind of on a very general basis?\nI think with respect to processing, we do see pressure in the US. The pricing pressure in the international markets is no way near what we see in the US and we think that will help our overall pricing outlook as we grow the international business as a percentage of that overall business which will be the focus in 2015.\n\nThe text discusses revenue shortfalls, pricing pressures, and cost reduction strategies in the eDiscovery business, with a focus on domestic vs. international markets."

    "gold_answer": "To calculate the potential impact:\n\n- **Step 1**: Assume the base loss ratio (LR) is 70%.\n- **Step 2**: A 10% discount implies a 10% reduction in premium revenue per policy.\n- **Step 3**: A 5% increase in policy uptake means more policies but at a lower premium.\n- **Step 4**: The new LR can be estimated as:\n  \\( LR_{new} = \\frac{Claims}{Premium \\times (1 - 0.10) \\times (1 + 0.05)} \\)\n  \\( LR_{new} = \\frac{0.70}{0.90 \\times 1.05} \\approx 74.07\\% \\)\n- **Conclusion**: The loss ratio increases to ~74.07% due to the discount and higher uptake.",
    "question_context": "The response to pet has actually been quite positive, quite strong. And I would think of maybe the whole business in aggregate and the way we think about expenses and losses in the combined ratio aspect, which is more of a traditional insurance view is, we've got improvements coming everywhere.\nGenerally, people have more than one type of policy, or better risks. They have more coverage, they are thinking more thoughtfully about what they protect.

We do cover based on NII and we're going to watch it carefully over the coming quarters and see where things go and stay tuned. Like I said, I think everybody on this call can sort of run their numbers and figure out what's achievable.\nWe always have a pretty good discussion with the Board around our fees. I think we're sort of in the middle of the path of a very attractive incentive fee structure, which I think has provided the shareholders with a good alignment of interest with us.

Can you just talk a little bit about what you did with home delivery pricing, I know it's bundled, but the home delivery pricing this last year, and what your thoughts are on home delivery pricing this upcoming year please?\nSure. Yeah, we've obviously, we have 30 markets and so this isn't a one size fits all across all of McClatchy, but we have as many of our peers have been doing, working with Mather Economics and other partners to continue to go to more of a dynamic pricing model for our home delivery customers and our print customers and our digital only customers as well. And so we did take prices up in several areas across our markets, which help to offset some of the volume declines that we see every year from the print combo subscribers. And we did obviously try to offset that as well with more digital only subscribers, which we had pretty good success at.\nOne of the data points there is that if you look at improvements that we've seen in digital only since we've launched our new subscriber platform, we've continued to see acceleration of the growth rate in revenue in that area all year long since it's pretty strong numbers as we talked about earlier in the call remarks in terms of 24% growth in digitalonly subscribers in the fourth quarter.

    "question_context": "In our third quarter earnings call in early November, we provided preliminary guidance range for 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $2.35B to $2.5B with a midpoint of $2.43B. We have reduced the midpoint of our acquisition adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 by 6.5% from just over $2.5B to $2.35B.\nNatural gas prices have declined by 30% or more, these combined declines in commodity prices have collectively reduced the level of cash flow producers have available to reinvest by a meaningful amount. In response, most producers have significantly reduced their capital budgets for 2015 relatively to 2014 actual levels as well as relative to their initial 2015 plan.\n\nPAA revised its 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance due to declining crude oil and natural gas prices, which impacted producers' capital budgets and PAA's performance."

Assuming etrasimod captures 10% of the remaining market (950,000 patients), the potential penetration would be 95,000 patients.\n3. Formula: \\( \\text{Potential Penetration} = \\text{Total Market} \\times (1 - \\text{Current Penetration}) \\times \\text{Market Share} \\).\n4. Assumptions:\n   - Etrasimod's safety profile and efficacy are superior to current oral agents.\n   - Physician adoption rates are consistent with historical trends for new oral therapies.",

    "question": "2) Given the 200 basis points compression in EBITDA margin, what was the EBITDA margin in Q2 if Q3's margin was 15%?",
    "gold_answer": "1. **Q3 EBITDA margin**: 15%\n2. **Basis points compression**: 200 bps (or 2 percentage points)\n\nQ2 EBITDA margin = Q3 margin + compression = 15% + 2% = **17%**",
    "question_context": "Supply chain disruptions and labor inefficiencies in the quarter accounted for approximately $8 million of negative impact to EBITDA. These headwinds included delayed shipments and plant inefficiencies resulting from the disruptions. Higher per unit costs for raw material, labor and other manufacturing costs negatively impacted the quarter an additional $5 million. These costs were partially offset by lower G&A incentives and other costs in the quarter by approximately $5 million. Collectively, these costs led to a further EBITDA margin compression of approximately 200 basis points in the third quarter results as compared to the second quarter.\nOur aerospace and high-strength shipments in the first half of 2021 were up 37% from the second half of 2020, and we expect shipments will continue to increase in the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of the year. Although we are pleased to see the recovery in the aero and high-strength underway, the challenging operating environment impacted our ability to meet demand in the third quarter.\nShipments and value-added revenue for the quarter declined by 17% and 15%, respectively from the second quarter. The updated IHS industry forecast for North American vehicle builds has declined from 16.3 million vehicles to 13.0 vehicles for the year due specifically to the chip shortage.\nWe initially anticipated value-added revenue will be up 10% to 15% year-over-year compared to 2021. However, with continued strength in demand, we are now on pace for a greater than 25% increase of value-added revenue year-over-year due to heavy restocking and re-shoring of OEM supply chains and strength of our KaiserSelect products.\n\nThe text discusses Kaiser's third quarter 2021 results, highlighting challenges such as labor shortages, inflationary costs, and supply chain disruptions.

    "gold_answer": "Given neighboring wells at 300-400 bbl/day (40% oil = 120-160 bbl oil/day), breakeven requires covering operational costs. If fixed costs are $X/bbl, the minimum rate is $X/(0.4 \\times \\text{price per bbl})$.",

So, that well just really didn't -- it gave us some test data, but not much else.\nThe highest one was 1,000 barrels a day, but there is now three or four over there with 300 to 400 barrel-a-day rates. That is the starting point for us, and we'll see where we go from there.\n\nThe Marmaton well in the DJ Basin showed a 40% oil cut, with vertical testing providing key data for lateral development.

In isolation, any one of those really wasn't a terribly material item, but it was still $5 million.\nthe increased incidence of claims, about $2 million, this is the first quarter that we saw that. We had higher claim levels this time last year, but it was specifically related to cancer products. This time around there was a slight uptick in cancer claims, but it was largely other critical illness products.\non the lower persistency and the newer products this is the second quarter in a row that we've seen it. So our view is that one or even two quarters does not make a trend.

So, there aren't many utilities in the world and having sold to utilities for almost 40 years, that would rely entirely on spot cargoes to provide fuel to new power plants that they're building with 40-year-long lived asset.

And then increasingly, over the rest of this year, we will see investments in the store network. And we do believe that that is in contrast to the work we'll do on around efficiencies.\nSo on that side of things, we saw three main areas that we believe will continue to prove beneficial from an efficiency perspective. So the first is really opportunities to simplify how we work through new ways of working. And we see significant scale and leverage opportunities as we grow, especially in North America, taking advantage of our store network. And then lastly, we've seen opportunity to work more closely with our most important landlord partners to win -- to find win-win occupancy agreements.

The technical challenge of intratumoral injection is that a tumor has a high fat content and is pressurized. This is an environment that is highly incompatible with water-based products.\nAt Intensity, we have adopted that molecular technology and created a patented product that after direct intratumoral injection disperses the two potent cytotoxic agents, cisplatin and vinblastine, comprising our formulation into and throughout the tumor, and that technology also allows for the diffusion of those compounds into the cancer cells themselves.\nAnother innovation of our approach is that we dose based on the patient's visible tumor burden.

    "question_context": "Yes. So I don't have that data in front of me. I can tell you that as I said in the script, if you look at the top 25 customers, I think what you would find is that the average drop in those customers is increasing. And so it's increasing either because they're taking share from others. The really interesting data point, John, is when you look at the top customers that are having the greatest deal of -- greatest degree of growth, they actually buy both conventional and natural from UNFI.\nWell, again, the economies of scale for wholesale are the same whether it's food service or retail, and that is average drop, right? Bigger the average drop, the better the economies of scale are for us because we can work on less if we're delivering more. It's the age old analogy of delivering a full truckload a mile from the DC versus working at $40\\%$ on $\\$1$ ,000 order 800 miles away, right? There's no way that's going to work. And so it's really less about whether it's top 25 customer, and it's more about how much freight can we deliver to a customer location on one truck.\n\nThe company explains the importance of average drop size in achieving economies of scale and its impact on profitability."

    "question_context": "Our view on the dividend is everybody on this call can run the math on what's possible in terms of what we can achieve for earnings. I think sort of the high end, sort of all things being equal and if we deployed all the capital in the SBIC and the remaining capital that we have, is we could get into the sort of 40-ish range or low 40s. Right now, we did 28 (38:59) this quarter. Expenses were a little higher, which was still unusual. But I see sort of on a pro forma basis for the last quarter, it's probably somewhere around 29 or 30 (39:07). If we deploy half of the capital or the cash that we have available, we would cover on adjusted basis.\nThe choice is to basically stick with where we're at right now even though we don't cover on an adjusted basis. We do cover based on NII and we're going to watch it carefully over the coming quarters and see where things go and stay tuned. Like I said, I think everybody on this call can sort of run their numbers and figure out what's achievable.\nWe always have a pretty good discussion with the Board around our fees. I think we're sort of in the middle of the path of a very attractive incentive fee structure, which I think has provided the shareholders with a good alignment of interest with us. Obviously, we haven't been paid in a while. We don't deserve to be paid based on the performance. But others certainly in the peer group would have gotten paid.\n\nThe company discusses its dividend policy and fee structure, highlighting potential earnings scenarios and capital deployment strategies."

    "question": "8) Qualitatively, what factors could explain the reduction in MBS premium amortization from $8.3 million in Q3 to $7 million in Q4?",
    "gold_answer": "Possible factors include:\n1. Changes in prepayment speeds due to interest rate movements\n2. Portfolio runoff or sales of higher-premium MBS\n3. Adjustments to amortization methods or assumptions\n4. Decreased premium balances as existing premiums are amortized over time\n5. Shifts in the composition of the MBS portfolio toward lower-premium securities",
    "question_context": "The yields came down about 12 basis points sequentially. But half of that was associated with the timing of fees. So there are fees associated with loans that are released into interest income. And so there can be some timing, there was some more income in the Third Quarter compared to the Fourth Quarter. We also had a interest recovery in the Third Quarter that did not repeat in the Fourth Quarter. When you strip that out, the change was about 6 basis points negative.\nSo we're still trending down. And what we saw into the Fourth Quarter was, in terms of the average of new loan yields versus what was either paid off or matured, was a minus 47 basis points. Now that number actually is less compared to the Third Quarter, which had been 75 basis points. So still negative, but a smaller negative. And again, that's all related to the 6 basis point compression in the Fourth Quarter.\nThe Third Quarter MBS amortization was $8.3 million, and it was $7 million in the Fourth Quarter.\n\nDetailed discussion of loan yield trends and premium amortization, including specific basis point changes and factors affecting these metrics."

    "question": "5) Compare Verano’s M&A strategy (\"go deeper\") with a \"footprint expansion\" approach. Which offers better ROI in the current regulatory environment?",
    "gold_answer": "1. **Deeper Strategy**: Focuses on operational synergies, brand consolidation, and margin improvement in existing markets. Lower regulatory risk (familiarity with state laws).  \n2. **Expansion Strategy**: Higher growth potential but faces regulatory hurdles (new licenses, compliance costs).  \n3. **ROI**: \"Go deeper\" likely superior near-term due to scalability and adult-use conversion opportunities (e.g., CT).",
    "question_context": "Our goal has always been to go deeper. There are still a couple of markets that we would like to add some depth in, primarily possibly Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts, we'd like to add another store. But for the most part, we've gone pretty deep in the majority of our markets that we'd like to. And we are looking at opportunities outside of our current footprint like Connecticut. We thought that was a great opportunity for us, vertically integrated, one of the best cultivation and processing assets in that state, two very strong stores, and with adult-use on the horizon, it was a deal that made a tremendous amount of sense for Verano. The margin profile is there. More importantly, the team that's running those assets is going to integrate very well with the Verano team.\nAs far as pricing, private pricing, if you know how to negotiate, it falls in line with public pricing. We don't overpay for assets. We're not known for that. We pay within a certain margin profile. It also depends on how much capital has been deployed into those assets. So it's -- as we ebb and flow with the public market, the pricing in the private market ebbs and flows as well.\n\nVerano prioritizes deepening its presence in existing markets (e.g., AZ, NV, MA) while selectively expanding into new states (e.g., Connecticut). Pricing aligns with public market multiples, with disciplined negotiation to avoid overpaying."

We think they make good loans. We think that they'll figure out other ways to sell loans to people or whatever other alternatives they're considering. We're a minority of shareholders, we're not in it, don't have knowledge of exactly their current plan, but we just thought it was appropriate to mark down. We think we like consumer finance, we like short duration amortizing assets as a firm (27:57) something we're involved in.

    "question_context": "Sure, Vebs. I think this is – I mean it's a little bit – there's a lot of moving pieces here. So I'm glad you asked the question because I think more than one person had that one is we do see the improvement in the drill support. We've had a really strong vessel support Q2. Q3, we just haven't seen it happen yet. So remember that some of that vessel support is on call-out work which we have to see materialize. So we risk weight that a little bit when we put it in the forecast. There's weather in the third quarter, especially here in the Gulf of Mexico. So we've got to be a little cautious about what we put in.\nBut on the drill support – the underlying drill support, we do see it going up. I think you'll be able to see sort of the effect of drill support in the fourth quarter. So that will become more apparent. And then we've got a little bit of geographic mix that comes out because of the drill support which softens us a little bit versus some of the strength we've had in the vessel support, not just with the seasonal activity, but also we've had some really good upmanning on that vessel side as well in the second quarter.\nYeah. I think there are several key elements. We've talked about lower-than-anticipated margins which we obviously did not hit our expected margin profile on a job. That impacted us in Q2. So we don't see that as a recurring in Q3 or the back half the year. We also have some backlog that we'll be executing in the back half the year that we expect has higher margins in it. So that gives us the level of confidence going into the back half of the year as well. And then we talked a bit earlier about the renewable sector and how we're seeing more work and activity in the back half of the year than what we saw in the first half. So I think those are the key elements that we have line of sight to, Vebs, that gives us that confidence.\n\nThe text provides insights into the financial performance of various segments, including ROVs, Subsea Projects, and Subsea Products, along with guidance for future quarters."

    "question_context": "The first quarter and second quarter of the year tend to be highest enrollment in full service business. In the summertime, we started to see older children basically aging out of the preschool groups, sometimes families withdraw children as they go on vacation and then they reenroll in the fall or we're rebuilding enrollment in aging younger children into the preschool rooms. So, the third quarter you definitely see a pullback a bit on the full service side. And then in the back-up care world, we tended to have much steadier revenue stream because of the nature of the client contracts that we have, and then the costs are more variable depending on the provision of care.\n\nThe company experiences seasonal fluctuations in enrollment and profitability, with higher enrollment in the first and second quarters, a dip in the third quarter, and a rebound in the fourth quarter.

Our return on equity was 16.55% and our return on assets was 2.68%.\nFor the quarter, we originated $172.9 million of loans, and for the year, $587.8 million of loans. That's a record for us, both quarter-on-the-quarter and for the year by a substantial amount.\n93% or 94% of our originated loans are variable, tied to prime. In a rising interest rate environment, that is helpful to have variable rate loans.\nOur yield on our loan book for the quarter on originated loans was 7% and was 6.9% for the prior quarter. The yield only went up 10 basis points due to early loan payoffs and negotiated minimum interest payments.\nLoan Source purchased $12 billion of PPP loans from Q4 2020 through Q1 2022. At the end of June 30, 2022, $1.4 billion remained, with $9.8 billion paid off or forgiven.\nCorrespondent fee income went down by $4.7 million due to PPP loans being paid off or forgiven. Base net interest income increased by $4.3 million, offsetting the reduction in correspondent fee income.\nNet interest income increased by $16 million year-over-year, driven by a 30% growth in the National Lending portfolio and a 45% growth in originated loans.\nNon-interest expense grew by $1.5 million in Q4, primarily due to additional incentive compensation. For modeling purposes, a quarterly non-interest expense of around $13 million is suggested for FY '23.\n\nNortheast Bank reported strong financial performance with significant contributions from its National Lending loan volume.

There's typically some type of debt that's at a higher interest rate than you could pay it off with a personal loan and improve your credit score. So, that's one reason.\nThe second reason is that it's the most automated loan type.
