Second, the market must be efficient in the semistrong form.\n\nThis section discusses the performance of value stocks versus growth stocks across different countries, the concept of market efficiency, and the implications of accounting choices on stock prices.",

Because rich countries have higher capital-labor ratios, the marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich countries than in poor countries, and the former will therefore have a higher wage level than the latter.\n\nThis section explores the empirical regularity that price levels, when expressed in a single currency, are positively related to real income per capita. It discusses two competing theories—Balassa-Samuelson and Bhagwati-Kravis-Lipsey—that explain why nontradables are cheaper in poor countries, leading to lower overall price levels.",

Free cash flow generated by divisions in mature industries could be funneled within the company to other divisions with profitable growth opportunities.\nBerger and Ofek estimate the average conglomerate discount at 12 to 15 percent. Conglomerate discount means that the market value of the whole conglomerate is less than the sum of the values of its parts.\n\nThis section discusses the rise and fall of conglomerates in the U.S., their claimed advantages, and the challenges they face, particularly in internal capital markets.",

How can you conclude that dividend policy is irrelevant when this model is valid?\nElton and Gruber reported that the ex-dividend–date drop in a stock’s price as a percentage of the dividend should equal the ratio of 1 minus the ordinary income tax rate to 1 minus the capital gains rate; that is, $$\\frac{P_{e}-P_{b}}{D}=\\frac{1-T_{o}}{1-T_{c}}$$\nThe bird-in-the-hand argument, which states that a dividend today is safer than the uncertain prospect of a capital gain tomorrow, is often used to justify high dividend-payout ratios.\n\nThis section explores the theoretical and practical aspects of dividend policy, including the irrelevance of dividend policy under perfect markets, the impact of taxes, and real-world factors influencing dividend decisions.",

If he uses it as a capital, he employs it in the maintenance of productive labourers, who reproduce the value, with a profit. He can, in this case, both restore the capital, and pay the interest, without alienating or encroaching upon any other source of revenue. If he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate consumption, he acts the part of a prodigal, and dissipates, in the maintenance of the idle, what was destined for the support of the industrious.\nThe quantity of stock, therefore, or, as it is commonly expressed, of money, which can be lent at interest in any country, is not regulated by the value of the money, whether paper or coin, which serves as the instrument of the different loans made in that country, but by the value of that part of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either from the ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is destined, not only for replacing a capital, but such a capital as the owner does not care to be at the trouble of employing himself.\nAs the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases, the interest, or the price which must be paid for the use of that stock, necessarily diminishes, not only from those general causes which make the market price of things commonly diminish as their quantity increases, but from other causes which are peculiar to this particular case. As capitals increase in any country, the profits which can be made by employing them necessarily diminish.\n\nThis section discusses Adam Smith's analysis of the nature and implications of lending stock at interest, distinguishing between productive and unproductive uses of borrowed capital, and the factors influencing the rate of interest.",

If it is negatively related to inflation, its inflation beta is negative, and if it is uncorrelated with inflation, its inflation beta is zero.\nThe model we have been looking at is called a factor model, and the systematic sources of risk, designated F, are called the factors. A k-factor model is a model where each stock’s return is generated by $$ R=\\overline{R}+\\beta_1F_1+\\beta_2F_2+....+\\beta_kF_k+\\epsilon $$ where \\epsilon is specific to a particular stock and uncorrelated with the \\epsilon term for other stocks.\n\nThis section explores the decomposition of stock returns into expected and unexpected components, and further into systematic and unsystematic risks. It introduces factor models, including the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and discusses the role of beta coefficients in measuring systematic risk.",

In equilibrium, wagesetters correctly anticipate these incentives, and raise expected inflation accordingly, so that output continues to grow at its natural rate.\n$$ V^{N}=\\frac{\\lambda^{2}+\\delta\\bar{\\pi}^{2}}{2(1-\\delta^{2})},~V^{R}-V^{N}=-\\frac{K(1+\\delta)}{1-\\delta^{2}(1-F(0))}, $$ where $1-F(0)$ is the equilibrium probability of re-election perceived by the incumbent in all future elections (he recognizes that future inflation surprises are not possible in equilibrium).\n\nThis section discusses the equilibrium conditions in the moral hazard model where wage-setters and voters have symmetric information, leading to predictable inflation and output growth.",

Because central banks typically do not pay interest on reserves, the bank earns nothing on them and loses the interest that could have been earned if the bank held loans instead.\nThe channel or corridor system for conducting monetary policy—which has been adopted by Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, all of which have eliminated reserve requirements—shows that central banks can continue to effectively set overnight, interbank interest rates like the federal funds rate.\nIn the channel/corridor system, the central bank sets up a standing lending facility, like the one currently in place in the United States and in most industrialized countries, in which the central bank stands ready to lend overnight any amount banks ask for at a fixed interest rate, $i^{l}$.\nIn the channel/corridor system the central bank sets up another standing facility that pays banks a fixed interest rate $i^{r}$ on any reserves (deposits) they would like to keep at the central bank.\n\nThis section discusses the global trend of reducing or eliminating reserve requirements by central banks and introduces the channel/corridor system for setting interest rates, which allows central banks to maintain control over interest rates even in the absence of reserve requirements.",

Let us consider a production function $Q=Q(K,L)$ ,where $Q,K$ and $L$ denote output, capital input, and labor input, respectively. This function is a particular two-variable version of (7.12), with ${n=2}$ . We can therefore define two partial derivatives $\\partial Q/\\partial K$ (or $Q\\_{K}$ ) and $\\partial Q/\\partial L$ (or $\\boldsymbol{Q}\\_{L}$ ). The partial derivative $Q\\_{\\kappa}$ relates to the rates of change in output with respect to infinitesimal changes in capital, while labor input is held constant. Thus $Q\\_{K}$ symbolizes the marginalphysical-product-of-capital $({\\bf M P P}\\_{K})$ function. Similarly, the partial derivative $\\boldsymbol{Q}\\_{L}$ is the mathematical representation of the $\\mathbf{MPP}\\_{L}$ function.\n\nThis section introduces partial derivatives, their geometric interpretation, and their application in economics, particularly in production functions.",

In other words, when workers already have a large quantity of capital to use in producing goods and services, giving them an additional unit of capital increases their productivity only slightly.\nThe diminishing returns to capital has another important implication: Other things equal, it is easier for a country to grow fast if it starts out relatively poor. This effect of initial conditions on subsequent growth is sometimes called the catch-up effect.\nInvestment from abroad takes several forms. Ford Motor Company might build a car factory in Mexico. A capital investment that is owned and operated by a foreign entity is called foreign direct investment. Alternatively, an American might buy stock in a Mexican corporation (that is, buy a share in the ownership of the corporation); the Mexican corporation can use the proceeds from the stock sale to build a new factory. An investment that is financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents is called foreign portfolio investment.\nEducation—investment in human capital—is at least as important as investment in physical capital for a country’s long-run economic success. In the United States, each year of schooling raises a person’s wage on average by about 10 percent. In less developed countries, where human capital is especially scarce, the gap between the wages of educated and uneducated workers is even larger.\nAnother way in which policymakers can foster economic growth is by protecting property rights and promoting political stability. Property rights refer to the ability of people to exercise authority over the resources they own. A mining company will not make the effort to mine iron ore if it expects the ore to be stolen.\n\nThis section explores the concepts of diminishing returns to capital and the catch-up effect, which explain why poor countries tend to grow faster than rich countries when they invest in capital. It also discusses the implications of these concepts for economic growth policies.",

Because demand deposits are held in banks, the behavior of banks can influence the quantity of demand deposits in the economy and, therefore, the money supply.\nIn a system of 100-percent-reserve banking, banks hold all deposits as reserves and do not make loans. The money supply remains unchanged as deposits simply replace currency.\nIn fractional-reserve banking, banks hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves and loan out the rest, thereby creating money. The reserve ratio determines the extent of money creation.\nThe money multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio (1/R), indicating how much money the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves.\nThe Fed uses three primary tools to control the money supply: open-market operations, reserve requirements, and the discount rate.\n\nThis section explores the role of banks in the monetary system, focusing on how fractional-reserve banking influences the money supply and the mechanisms through which the Federal Reserve controls it.",

If $X\\_{t}\\in S\\_{1}$ , party $^{1}$ chooses the division $y\\_{t},1-y\\_{t}$ , where $y\\_{t}$ is the share of party 1. If $X\\_{t}\\in S\\_{2}$ , party 2 chooses the division. At each point in time, each party has the option of choosing \\\"autarky,\\\" in which case its share is 1 when it is in power and zero when it is not in power.\n\nThis section explores a model where two political parties divide a fixed-size pie over time, with shares determined by a Markov state variable.

A reference system is a standard economic model/theory that results in desired or ideal results, such as efficiency/the 'first best'.\nAn economic theory has three possible roles: (1) It can be used to explain economic behavior and economic phenomena in the real world.

Illegal transactions are often conducted in cash to avoid traceability, increasing the demand for currency relative to checkable deposits.\n\nThis section examines the factors influencing the currency ratio ($c$) and its historical trends, including the roles of wealth, expected returns, bank panics, and illegal activity. Understanding these dynamics is essential for analyzing money supply fluctuations.",

Consequently, the demand curve for reserves, $R^{d}$ , slopes downward in Figure 1.\nThe supply of reserves, $R^{s}$ , can be broken up into two components: the amount of reserves that are supplied by the Fed’s open market operations, called nonborrowed reserves $(R_{n})$ , and the amount of reserves borrowed from the Fed, called discount loans $(D L)$.\nThe primary cost of borrowing discount loans from the Fed is the interest rate the Fed charges on these loans, the discount rate $(i_{d})$. Because borrowing federal funds is a substitute for taking out discount loans from the Fed, if the federal funds rate $i_{f f}$ is below the discount rate $i_{d}.$ then banks will not borrow from the Fed and discount loans will be zero because borrowing in the federal funds market is cheaper.\n\nThis section explains the supply and demand dynamics in the market for reserves, which determines the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve uses three policy tools—open market operations, discount lending, and reserve requirements—to influence this market and thereby control the money supply and interest rates.",

Thus, other things equal, Home tends to produce a higher ratio of cloth to food.\nTrade produces a convergence of relative prices. Changes in relative prices, in turn, have strong effects on the relative earnings of labor and land.\nOwners of a country's abundant factors gain from trade, but owners of a country's scarce factors lose.\nInternational trade leads to complete equalization of factor prices. Although Home has a higher ratio of labor to land than Foreign, once they trade with each other the wage rate and the rent on land are the same in both countries.\nIn the real world factor prices are not equalized. For example, there is an extremely wide range of wage rates across countries.\n\nThis section explores the effects of international trade between two-factor economies, focusing on the Heckscher-Ohlin model. It discusses how differences in factor endowments (labor and land) between countries influence trade patterns, relative prices, and income distribution.",

If a currency is trading at a lower price against another currency on the forward market than on the spot market, it is said to be at a discount. If, however, the currency is more expensive forward than spot, it is said to be at a premium. What determines whether a currency trades at a premium or discount is the interest rate differential in money markets. The currency with higher/lower interest rate will sell at a discount/premium in the forward market against the currency with the lower/higher interest rate.\n\nThis section discusses the concepts of spot and forward exchange rates, the determinants of currency premiums or discounts, and the role of interest rate differentials.",

Suppose you are offered a gamble in which you win $\\$1000$ half the time but lose $\\$1000$ half the time. Since you are as likely to win as to lose the $\\$1000$, the average payoff on this gamble——-its expected value—- is $(\\%)\\times(\\mathbb{S}1000)+(\\%)\\times(-\\mathbb{S}1000)=0.$\nIn general, a portfolio whose return fluctuates wildly from year to year is less desirable than one that offers the same average return with only mild year-to-year fluctuations. This observation is basic to understanding why countries exchange assets.\nInternational trade in assets can make both parties to the trade better off by allowing them to reduce the riskiness of the return on their wealth. Trade accomplishes this reduction in risk by allowing both parties to diversify their portfolios---to divide their wealth among a wider spectrum of assets and thus reduce the amount of money they have riding on each individual asset.\nIn thinking about asset trades it is frequently useful to make a distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments. Bonds and bank deposits are debt instruments, since they specify that the issuer of the instrument must repay a fixed value (the sum of principal plus interest) regardless of economic circumstances. In contrast, a share of stock is an equity instrument: It is a claim to a firm's profits, rather than to a fixed payment, and its payoff will vary according to circumstance.\n\nThis section discusses the gains from international trade, focusing on asset exchanges and portfolio diversification. It explains how risk aversion influences asset trade decisions and the role of the international capital market in facilitating these trades.",

    "gold_answer": "1. **Initial Balance Sheet**: Let $A_0$ be initial assets and $L_0$ be initial liabilities. Net worth is $NW_0 = A_0 - L_0$.\n2. **Price Level Decline**: A 25% deflation implies assets' nominal value falls to $A_1 = 0.75A_0$ (assuming asset values are price-level sensitive). Liabilities remain $L_0$.\n3. **New Net Worth**: $NW_1 = A_1 - L_0 = 0.75A_0 - L_0$.\n4. **Change in Net Worth**: $\\Delta NW = NW_1 - NW_0 = -0.25A_0$. This shows net worth deteriorates proportionally with the price decline, exacerbating adverse selection.",
