This is a $b$ variate generalization of the familiar beta density. For an elementary exposition on Dirichlet distributions and some properties, see Wilks [11] and for a more detailed discussion as well as tables, see Sobel et al. [9].

The parameters η, δ, ξ, and λ are to be determined from the first four moments of an observed distribution. For distributions not too far from normality, the problem reduces to determining ω and Ω from given values of β₁ and γ₂, where ω = e^(1/δ²) and Ω = η/δ. If the distribution is symmetrical about the origin, then β₁ = 0, implying Ω = 0, and γ₂ can be expressed in terms of ω as γ₂ = (1/8)(ω⁴ - 1)(ω⁴ + 3).
