The parameters η, δ, ξ, and λ are to be determined from the first four moments of an observed distribution. For distributions not too far from normality, the problem reduces to determining ω and Ω from given values of β₁ and γ₂, where ω = e^(1/δ²) and Ω = η/δ. If the distribution is symmetrical about the origin, then β₁ = 0, implying Ω = 0, and γ₂ can be expressed in terms of ω as γ₂ = (1/8)(ω⁴ - 1)(ω⁴ + 3).

This is a $b$ variate generalization of the familiar beta density. For an elementary exposition on Dirichlet distributions and some properties, see Wilks [11] and for a more detailed discussion as well as tables, see Sobel et al. [9]. Incomplete Dirichlet integrals are strongly connected with the multinomial and negative multinomial probabilities and these relations are explored in Olkin and Sobel [7] and Khatri and Mitra [5]. The integral $J_{p}^{(b)}(1,n)$ is defined for $0<p<1/b$ as the probability of the event $\\{Y_{i}>p,i=1,...,b\\}$ and is given by $J_{p}^{(b)}(1,n)={\\frac{n!}{(n-b)!}}\\int_{p}^{1}\\cdot\\stackrel{\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot}{\\scriptscriptstyle\\downarrow^{b}y_{1}\\leqslant1\\atop1}\\int_{p}^{1}\\left(1-\\sum_{1}^{b}y_{i}\\right)^{n-b}\\prod_{1}^{b}d y_{i}$.
