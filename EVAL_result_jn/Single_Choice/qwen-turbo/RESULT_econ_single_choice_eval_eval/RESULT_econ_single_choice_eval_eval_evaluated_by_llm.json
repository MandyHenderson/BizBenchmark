An adverse financial shock tightens the collateral constraint for borrowing working capital, reducing firm production scale. Since equity is used as collateral, the shock incentivizes firms to reallocate financing from intertemporal debt to equity. Equity is a more costly form of financing due to lower patience among investors compared to workers, raising the cost of financing new firm entry and deterring potential entrants. The model shows that this endogenous financing choice transmits financial shocks to affect not only production and profits but also the level of new firm entry. The adjustment in firm numbers buffers the effect on firm size and profits, mitigating the macroeconomic impact of the shock.",

    "question_context": "Extant studies find that genetic distance can pose an obstacle to the adoption of new technology (Spolaore & Wacziarg, 2009). While genetic distance is typically calculated using protein polymorphism data, some are of the view that surname distance provides just as reliable a measure as other alleles at a locus for measuring the consanguinity of populations (Baek et al., 2007; Du et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2012; Yuan & Zhang, 2002). From this vantage point, surname distance may be considered a sound proxy for genetic distance and as such has an indirect effect on the diffusion of technology. To verify this conjecture, we examine the correlation between our historical surname distance measure and a genetic distance measure based on the frequency distribution of the A, B, and O alleles of the ABO gene in the 1980s. The left-hand side of panel B of Fig. 2, which provides a binned scatterplot between the two measures, shows that they are indeed positively correlated. By regressing genetic distance (computed according to the ABO frequency) on historical surname distance, the beta coefficient of 0.536 (Table C2 in Appendix C2) suggests that the distribution of surnames can indeed be a sound proxy for the distribution of alleles at a locus.",

The hump-shaped response of firm entry matches empirical observations. Equity price falls on impact, but then improves over time. The fall in equity price reflects both the protracted fall in dividends and the fall in firm discount factor. The mechanism driving the change in discount factor is as follows: firms shift from debt to equity financing by deferring current dividends, which lowers investor consumption and their stochastic discount factor. The impulse responses show declines in dividend, investor consumption, and discount factor. The equation for firm dividends is: $$d_{i,t}=\\left(\\frac{1+\\sigma\\mu_{t}}{\\sigma-1}\\frac{w_{t}}{A_{t}}\\right)\\tilde{n}_{t}^{-\\gamma}Y_{t}-\\left(b_{i,t-1}-b_{i,t}\\big/R_{t}\\right).$$",

The study leverages the natural experiment provided by Hurricane Katrina to isolate the effect of geographic displacement and disruption on mortality schedules.",

It assesses three main factors: (1) Conceptual measures of income (e.g., pre-tax vs. after-tax, business wealth), finding these do not significantly affect underreporting estimates (Table 4, columns 1-4). (2) Differences in hours worked, controlled for via log work hours, showing minimal impact on underreporting estimates (Table 4, column 2). (3) Saving propensities, tested via age segmentation and wealth quartiles, revealing no substantial differences (Table 4, columns 3-4). The analysis concludes that none of these factors primarily drive the observed underreporting gap, with conceptual income measures showing the least explanatory power.",

We consider this to be an upper bound because it attributes the coefficient on extra work to pure transaction costs, rather than marginal costs of production. This amounts to an assumption of a 100 percent profit margin on extra work, making it analogous to positive adjustments in compensation. A more conservative approach is presented in the bottom panel. In the extreme, firms may perform extra work at a zero profit margin, meaning each dollar awarded through a change in scope just covers the cost of performing that work. With $1 of marginal costs for every $1 of extra work, that still leaves approximately $0.23 to be explained by transaction or adaptation costs.

In the scenario with a large sample size (N=100,000) and a small discontinuity in treatment probability (Δp=14%), the confidence intervals are the widest among all scenarios considered. This is highlighted by the equation: \n\n$$ \n\\Delta p=\\phi\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2}+\\sigma_{D}^{2}}}\\right)-\\phi\\left(0\\right). \n$$ \n\nThe results indicate that even for relatively large sample sizes, a small jump at the threshold in the probability of treatment can result in significant widening of confidence intervals.",

Key findings include that women living further from radiation facilities are more likely to receive mastectomies and less likely to receive lumpectomies. Additionally, demographic differences are noted: women closer to radiation facilities tend to be older, less likely to be white, less likely to be married, and more likely to have Medicaid as a primary payment source. Neighborhood characteristics also vary, with those closer to facilities living in slightly poorer neighborhoods but with higher median home values.

Both type of shocks affect the uninformed investors’ expectations of the aggregate supply but in very different directions. If an unexpected price increase is due to good news on cash flow such as an unexpectedly high dividend, the uninformed investors will infer that their previous estimate of Π is too low and so is that of Θ. This implies that they have been holding less than the optimal share of the market since they have underestimated Θ. Hence, they will update their expectation by increasing their estimate of the market, Θ̂, and buy more stock shares. If an unexpected price increase is not due to cash-flow-related information, it must be due to a decrease of the aggregate supply (i.e. Θ). In this case, the uninformed investors will lower Θ̂ and sell their shares accordingly. Therefore, under information asymmetry the uninformed investors’ reaction to an unexpected price increase is positive (to buy) if it is due to cash-flow related shocks and negative (to sell) if it is not. The overall response to price changes is the net of these two effects. As shown by Figure 8, for some parameter values the information effect of cash-flow-related shocks can dominate. In this case, σPΘ̂>0 and the uninformed investors buy the stock when the price rises and sell when the price drops. Clearly, the trend-chasing behaviour is associated with information asymmetry.",

The inclusion of men gives them more control—and hence ability to obstruct women's choices—but at the same time the psychological benefit to the husband can have positive spillovers on the wife. Under both a collective and a noncooperative model, because of a simple revealed preference argument (the wife could choose to turn over the voucher to the husband or use it in the Individual condition), and because the husband has decision rights over the use of the voucher in the Couple group, we would predict that contraceptive use and welfare would be higher for women in the Individual treatment than in the Couple treatment.",

The natural 'realized' benchmark for the multi-step-ahead forecasts at horizon $n$ is given by the corresponding integrated volatility $$ I V_{t+1:t+n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}I V_{t+i} $$.",

The results show that informing voters about the LDF led to a decrease in support for incumbents, as voters became aware of underutilization of the fund. However, politicians responded by increasing vote buying, which neutralized the electoral consequences of the information. The key finding is encapsulated in the equation: \\[ \\Delta V = I - B \\], where \\Delta V represents the change in incumbent vote share, I is the initial negative impact of information, and B is the counteracting effect of vote buying. This dynamic highlights how politicians in clientelistic systems can adapt to information shocks to maintain electoral support.",

This keeps the neighborhoods equal sized in the initial allocation with Tiebout choice alone.

    "question_context": "Corollary 3 indicates the coefficient of relative risk aversion does not have to be very high for quantity regulation to be optimal: a coefficient of relative risk aversion greater than one-half is sufficient, and most studies find the coefficient of relative risk aversion between one and three. The concavity of the production function is generally straightforward to check. For example, suppose a Cobb–Douglas production function $f(k, E) = k^{1-\\gamma}E^{\\gamma}$. Then the first condition requires simply $R''(c) \\geq 2$. Finally, any convexity in the damage function further tilts the result toward quantity regulation. The second part of Corollary 3 compares our results with Weitzman [27]. The essential difference is that in general equilibrium, we model the consumer side of the economy. Corollary 3 makes a linear approximation of the variance and covariance in the correlation coefficient, a key assumption of Weitzman and the subsequent literature. If $u(c) = c$, then the consumer side of the economy vanishes and a sufficient condition for quantities to dominate prices is $f_{ee} + B_{ee} \\geq 0$.",
