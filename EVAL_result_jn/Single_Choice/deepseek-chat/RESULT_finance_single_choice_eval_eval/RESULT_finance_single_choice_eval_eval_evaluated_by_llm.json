    "question_context": "The paper advocates two ways to make more efficient use of available information in reducing the bias of the risk premium estimate in two-pass tests of the CAPM. First, explicit modelling of the time-variability of betas can improve the accuracy of the beta forecasts. Second, the cross-sectional information available can be exploited more efficiently using individual stocks instead of portfolios provided that noisy beta predictions are given a smaller weight than more accurate ones. This paper proposes an adjustment of the cross-sectional regressions of excess returns against betas to give larger weights to more reliable beta forecasts. A significant positive relationship between returns and the beta forecast is obtained when the proposed approach is applied to data from the Helsinki Stock Exchange, while the traditional Fama–MacBeth approach as such finds no relationship at all. The paper recommends the recursive Kalman filter technique for producing more accurate beta forecasts, especially on small markets with a small number of stocks, many of which are relatively volatile and infrequently traded.",

    "question_context": "The model distinguishes three borrower types: higher-income (benchmark), conservative low-income (CL), and aggressive low-income (AL) borrowers. For CL borrowers, the IO loan reduces current debt service requirements and payment-driven default risk at the cost of higher future equity-driven default risk, presenting a clear trade-off. In contrast, benchmark and AL borrowers experience a net increase in risk with IO loans, as these induce larger house purchases (more debt) without reducing payment-driven default risk. The model's key insight is that IO loans provide a risk trade-off only for CL borrowers, as stated: 'IO loans provide a trade-off between income risk and price risk only for CL borrowers, while producing a net increase in risk for other types of borrowers.'",

Thus, changes in capital which occur for reasons such as those enumerated above should be explicitly included in the model. Each of these factors can be easily accommodated, thereby allowing their effects to be included when determining optimal asset management decisions. It should not be assumed, of course, that these considerations imply that future levels of capital funds can be precisely forecasted. On the contrary, changes in capital will occur for various reasons exogenous to the model. For example, changes in fees and commissions received from trust operations and bond trading activities can at best be forecasted imperfectly.

Thus, changes in capital which occur for reasons such as those enumerated above should be explicitly included in the model. Each of these factors can be easily accommodated, thereby allowing their effects to be included when determining optimal asset management decisions. It should not be assumed, of course, that these considerations imply that future levels of capital funds can be precisely forecasted. On the contrary, changes in capital will occur for various reasons exogenous to the model. For example, changes in fees and commissions received from trust operations and bond trading activities can at best be forecasted imperfectly. Since these other functions are basically independent of asset management, their effect on capital funds can be included in forecasts made externally and supplied as input to the model.",

Similarly, the mean reoffering yield (YIELD) for issues with a financial advisor is 5.62%; also significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the mean YIELD of 5.94% for bonds without financial advisors. The average underwriter gross spread (SPREAD) is 1.18% for all revenue bonds in the sample. Mean SPREAD is significantly lower (p < 0.01), 1.08% for issues with a financial advisor in comparison to the mean SPREAD of 1.34% for issues without a financial advisor.",

Focusing on Brazil, we examine a large-scale government program that aims to reduce the cost of long-term credit for borrowers by subsidizing the funding cost of lenders, while the credit allocation is left at the discretion of banks. Since banks with market power may try to retain a portion of the benefit intended for the borrower (e.g., by charging a higher interest rate in the subsidized loan), the program regulates the final price by setting an interest rate ceiling. We propose and test a mechanism whereby lenders with market power circumvent the rate cap by increasing the price of other loans to the same client (cross-product pricing) and thus capture part of the subsidy. This price increase is exclusive to the bank that is also providing the subsidized loan and is more pronounced for riskier firms and in markets where the banking industry is more concentrated.",

The proposition also holds for more general grid structures. For example, consider two sets of possible prices $\\mathcal{P}$ and $P^{\\prime}$, and say that $P^{\\prime}$ is coarser than $\\boldsymbol{P}$ if $P^{\\prime}\\subset P$. Then, Proposition 7 holds for $\\mathcal{P}$ and $P^{\\prime}$. The intuition underlying Proposition 7 is straightforward. When the minimum price variation is increased, the amount by which a dealer must undercut rivals' prices to capture the order flow is increased. Hence, the size of the immediate profits that a dealer obtains by undercutting the prevailing prices is smaller than before. Conversely, the expected future profits that a dealer anticipates if he or she were not to undercut the prevailing spread are higher under a larger minimum variation. As a result, any spreads that were sustainable before the grid was coarsened continue to be sustainable, making implicit collusion easier.",

This is because early exercise of a call is optimal only if the amount of the dividend thus captured exceeds the foregone interest on the exercise price.

As house prices decline, households with tightly binding borrowing constraints will default sooner than unconstrained households, because they value the immediate budget relief from default more highly relative to the longer-term costs. The degree to which borrowing constraints bind depends on the realizations of income shocks, the endogenously chosen level of savings, the level of interest rates, and the terms of the mortgage contract. For example, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) tend to default when interest rates increase, because high interest rates increase required mortgage payments on ARMs, tightening borrowing constraints and triggering defaults.",

Figure 6 shows the fitted 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year yields and their shadow counterparts, as defined in Equation (19), over the period 2008 to 2021. The top panel shows that the shadow 1-year yield was negative for most of the time between 2010 and 2015. The shadow 5-year rate fell to zero in 2012, putting it about $1\\%$ lower than the fitted yield, but it recovered to $1\\%$ in 2013. The figure shows a $1\\%$ spread between the 10-year yield and its shadow, but its shadow never reached zero during this episode. The coronavirus crisis looks particularly interesting in this light. The shadow short rate and 1-year yield were about $-1\\%$ at the time. However, both the 5-year and 10-year shadow yields fell to lower values (below $-1.5\\%$ by mid-2020. This suggests that the market expected a prolonged recession, with shadow short rates remaining negative for longer than one year.\n\nThis effect was first noted by Krippner (2013), who argued that it was largely spurious, due to the flexibility with which the standard three-factor EKF can estimate the SRTSM. It occurs because the weights that map the short shadow rates into the Black estimates are close to zero at the lower bound. Raising the lower bound parameter effectively reduces these weights to zero. Since the short rates can be approximated by the lower bound parameter instead of term structure factors, this leaves the algorithm with more freedom to fit the long end, resulting in overfitting.",

The shadow short rate and 1-year yield were about $-1\\%$ at the time. However, both the 5-year and 10-year shadow yields fell to lower values (below $-1.5\\%$ by mid-2020. This suggests that the market expected a prolonged recession, with shadow short rates remaining negative for longer than one year.\n\nThis effect was first noted by Krippner (2013), who argued that it was largely spurious, due to the flexibility with which the standard three-factor EKF can estimate the SRTSM. It occurs because the weights that map the short shadow rates into the Black estimates are close to zero at the lower bound. Raising the lower bound parameter effectively reduces these weights to zero. Since the short rates can be approximated by the lower bound parameter instead of term structure factors, this leaves the algorithm with more freedom to fit the long end, resulting in overfitting.",

It is shown that when the penalty paid to the principal by the agent in case of fraud ($k_2$) is less than the audit cost ($c$), the optimal contract entails overcompensation of the high-loss state and undercompensation of the low-loss state. Specifically, the agent receives greater utility in the high-loss state than in the low-loss state, leading to $\\beta_{\\mathrm{H}} > \\lambda_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{L}} < \\lambda_{\\mathrm{L}}$.

On the demand side, the availability of strip-down reduces the downside risk that homeowners face, making homeowning more attractive and therefore increasing demand for mortgages. On the supply side, the availability of strip-down in bankruptcy reduces lenders’ profits because default rates rise on both existing and new mortgages. Putting the demand and supply effects together, allowing strip-down of mortgages in bankruptcy is predicted to shift the demand for mortgage loans outward and shift the supply of mortgage loans inward. These changes mean that when strip-down is allowed, interest rates on mortgage loans are unambiguously predicted to rise, but approval rates for mortgage applications—our measure of supply—could either rise or fall.",

Thus, the contract described by (5) succeeds in establishing a separating signalling equilibrium. COROLLARY 5. The manager of a firm with Bad News will issue equity.

Attempts to widen the circle of relationships by borrowing from multiple lenders increases the price and reduces the availability of credit. In sum, relationships are valuable and appear to operate more through quantities rather than prices. Developing on this theme, other economists describe how large institutional creditors can (partially) overcome these frictions by producing information about the firm and using it in their credit decisions. If scale economies exist in information production, and information is durable and not easily transferred, these theories suggest that a firm with close ties to financial institutions should have a lower cost of capital and greater availability of funds relative to a firm without such ties. In addition to interaction over time, relationships can be built through interaction over multiple products. Borrowers may obtain more than just loans from a lender, especially if the lender is a bank. These added dimensions of a relationship can affect the firm's borrowing in two ways. First they increase the precision of the lender's information about the borrower. Second, the lender can spread any fixed costs of producing information about the firm over multiple products. Both effects reduce the lender's costs of providing loans and services, and the former effect increases the availability of funds to the firm.",

More intuitively, this points to an increased likelihood of a termination of lending relationships for small and opaque borrowers following an expansion of their bank into the underwriting market. Moreover, loan deals issued after such expansions may be less likely to contain credit lines, namely one of the key instruments to commit banks to screen and monitor borrowers with information problems (e.g., Berger et al. 2020, and references therein). Panel B then looks into the number of different type of loans within deals to study how the loan mix changes around bank mergers. Following Berg et al.

Key findings include: (1) Relative biases of sample autocorrelations of $y_{t}^{2}$ are comparable to those of $\\log(y_{t}^{2})$, but slightly larger in short-memory models and smaller in long-memory models. (2) Standard deviations of low-order sample autocorrelations are always larger for squared than for log-squared returns. (3) For absolute returns, sample autocorrelations are downward biased, with biases more severe in more persistent volatility models. The text concludes that sample autocorrelations are not reliable estimators in highly persistent LMSV models.",

This feature is consistent with the empirical results of Rubinstein (1985) and Knoch (1992). In contrast, stochastic volatility diffusion models do not exhibit significant biases for short times to maturity because the volatility is fairly certain over short intervals. Therefore, the log-gamma model appears to have some empirical advantages over diffusion models of option pricing. The log-gamma formula is also surprisingly different from the Black-Scholes (1973) formula because it depends on the mean parameter μ but not on the scale parameter σ.

A distinction is made between traditional lenders, who are price takers in the mortgage market, and nontraditional lenders, who invest in information to obtain some market power in a nontraditional mortgage market. Traditional lenders may allocate assets between government securities and mortgages to traditional borrowers, whereas nontraditional lenders may allocate assets between government securities, mortgages to traditional borrowers, and mortgages to nontraditional borrowers. The simulation results highlight that the traditional lender's portfolio choice is independent of changes in demand-side variables, whereas the nontraditional lender's is not.",
