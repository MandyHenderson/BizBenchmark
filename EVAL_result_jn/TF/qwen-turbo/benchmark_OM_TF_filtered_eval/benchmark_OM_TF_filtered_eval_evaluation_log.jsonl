The formula $r p_{i}^{j}=m_{j}\\times(d_{i})^{1-e_{j}}$ shows that the revenue per passenger depends on the distance $d_{i}$ raised to the power of $1-e_{j}$. The behavior of $r p_{i}^{j}$ with respect to $d_{i}$ depends on the value of the yield exponent $e_{j}$. If $e_{j} < 1$, then $1-e_{j} > 0$, and $r p_{i}^{j}$ increases with $d_{i}$. If $e_{j} > 1$, then $1-e_{j} < 0$, and $r p_{i}^{j}$ decreases with $d_{i}$. If $e_{j} = 1$, $r p_{i}^{j}$ is constant with respect to $d_{i}$.

While condition (ii) is necessary for concavity, it is not sufficient by itself. The proof shows that both conditions (i) and (ii) must hold simultaneously for the game to be concave. Condition (i) requires that the matroid (M, w) has no all-negative circuits, which is also essential. The necessity part of the proof demonstrates that if either condition is violated, concavity fails. Specifically, if (ii) does not hold, there exist cases where c(R + a) - c(R) < c(S + a) - c(S), violating concavity.

Hence, the maximum is achieved by considering paths of length up to $k$, leading to $A^{+}=\\bigoplus_{n\\in[1,k]}A^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explicitly states that since ρ_max(A) ≤ 0, all circuits have nonpositive weights, and removing circuits from a path makes its weight greater. Therefore, A⁺ can be simplified to A⁺ = ⊕_{n∈[1,k]} A^⊗n.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-2732-4-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-2732-4-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the reasoning and conclusion from the gold answer, confirming the simplification is valid due to nonpositive circuit weights.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-posneg-2732-4-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the reasoning and conclusion from the gold answer, confirming the simplification is valid due to nonpositive circuit weights."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-posneg-2732-4-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the reasoning and conclusion from the gold answer, confirming the simplification is valid due to nonpositive circuit weights."}

Explanation: The probit function $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

Explanation: Theorem 2(b) provides a lower bound of $1/4n^2$ for proportionality when the pieces must maintain the same fatness ($R$-fat) as the original rectangle.

The trade-off is clear: maintaining strict fatness constraints reduces the guaranteed proportionality, while relaxing fatness constraints allows for better proportionality guarantees. The $1/n$ proportionality in Theorem 2(c) is optimal in the sense that it matches the trivial upper bound (each agent getting at least $1/n$ of the total value), whereas the $1/4n^2$ bound in Theorem 2(b) leaves a substantial gap.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The condition shows that the marginal gain in market share from an additional dollar of advertising depends on $(1 - M_{1,t+1})$, which decreases as $M_{1,t+1}$ increases. This reflects decreasing marginal returns: as the brand's market share grows, the same advertising expenditure yields smaller incremental gains.

Based on the output equation Ŷ_S = Γ - [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] * D̂, is this claim mathematically supported by the formula, and what is the economic mechanism?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Mathematical Support: The output loss depends on the multiplier term [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] applied to the negative shock D̂. Assuming stability (denominator > 0), as κ increases, the term (μ+κγ_D) increases, making the denominator (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) smaller. This increases the magnitude of the entire fraction, thus amplifying the negative impact of D̂ on Ŷ_S. Economic Mechanism: Higher price flexibility (larger κ) means that a given negative output gap (Ŷ_S < 0) leads to a larger fall in prices (more negative π_S). Due to Fisherian debt deflation (nominal debts), falling prices increase the real debt burden for borrowers. This forces them to cut spending even more drastically, exacerbating the initial contraction. The debt-deflation channel dominates any potential benefits of faster price adjustment in this specific ZLB context.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context supports the claim mathematically.

The function $Z(\\mathbf{V})$ is known as the Beckmann transformation, and its minimization is mathematically equivalent to finding a Wardrop equilibrium (user-optimized equilibrium) under the assumption that $C_a(v)$ is non-decreasing. This is because the first-order optimality conditions of the minimization problem correspond to Wardrop's principle: for any used path between an origin-destination pair, the travel costs are equal and minimal.

The value of a technology depends not only on the number of concepts it is used in (through the summation over $C_t$) but also on the value of those concepts ($V_{cj}(x_c)$) and the number of technologies each concept uses ($T_c$).

Does this imply that lane-changing interactions permanently amplify the initial perturbation k_0 in individual lanes?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: While the solutions show K_1 → k_0/2 and K_2 → -k_0/2 as x → ∞, the total system perturbation ∑K_i = K_1 + K_2 = 0, meaning the initial perturbation k_0 is fully redistributed, not amplified. The apparent 'amplification' in individual lanes is an artifact of the redistribution process—lane-changing interactions split the initial perturbation symmetrically between lanes. This preserves mass conservation (no net density change), consistent with the zero row-sums of matrix A. The negative value for K_2 reflects relative density differences, not absolute amplification.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

The correct condition should be βD_high - D_low > (1/2)Y - β(1/2)Y = (1/2)(1-β)Y. Economic Intuition: The condition highlights that a large deleveraging shock (high D_high relative to D_low) forces borrowers to cut spending significantly. To maintain equilibrium, the real interest rate must fall substantially to induce patient savers (high β, meaning low discount rate 1-β) to increase their consumption. If the required spending shift is large enough relative to savers' willingness to substitute intertemporally, the natural rate needed to clear the market becomes negative.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

The first condition describes when a negative natural rate occurs, focusing on the relationship between debt levels and income, while the second formula represents the short-run natural rate itself.

Explanation: The all-express system's round-trip time formula is derived by setting hj = 0 (no local run floors) and nj = n (only express run to floor n). The general formula τj = t0 + t1hj + (2/v)⋅nj simplifies to τn = t0 + (2/v)⋅n when hj = 0. The term t0′ = t0 + t1 in the all-express formula accounts for the constant time component plus the time for serving a single floor, but this is not directly derived from the general formula by simply setting hj = 1. The correct interpretation is that the all-express system eliminates the local run term (hj = 0), and the constant term is adjusted to include the time for serving a single floor.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explicitly states that if a bank consists of a single floor (n), serving only a single floor (as in the all-express system), the round-trip time formula simplifies to τₙ=t₀′+(2/v)·n.

The paper states that for standard values of α and δ, the second exponential factor is approximately 1.01 to 1.017, which is close to 1.

True or False?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The paper explicitly states that multiplying the value function $V(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{t})$ by $\\mathsf{a}(t)^{-1}$ yields a normalized value function that is unique and satisfies the properties (i)-(iv). This normalization is part of the proof that the value function can be represented in the linear form $v(t,x)=a(t)x$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

Lemma 6.7's conclusion (μ^3t ≥^m μ^1k ∨ μ^2l) depends critically on the NA condition and the connectedness of payoff sets.

The text clarifies that ℰ_G′ differs from ℰ_G specifically for edges involving unpopular vertices (a ∈ U or b ∈ U). For such edges, c_x(a,b) is set to 1 in ℰ_G′, whereas ℰ_G uses the weight function wt_x(a,b).

While the paper states that under Assumptions 1 and 2 the optimal face is bounded and has a non-empty relative interior, Assumption 3 (N = ∅) is a simplifying assumption that may not hold in general. The paper explains that Assumption 3 can be achieved by reordering variables, but this does not imply it holds universally for all LCPs.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

The paper explicitly warns against this claim in Remark 3.1. The converse requires additional assumptions (e.g., KKT conditions being necessary/sufficient for global optimality of the lower-level problem near (x̄,ȳ)). Dempe and Dutta's counterexample shows this may fail even for convex lower-level problems.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The context does not mention bilevel programming, KKT-reformulated problems, or any specific relationship between solutions of such problems and the original bilevel problem.

Is it true that this formula implies the optimal bid always decreases as the future profit from winning the current contract ($\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$) increases?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The formula shows that the optimal bid $c_j^*$ decreases with $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ but increases with $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^0)$. The net effect depends on the relative magnitudes of these future profit terms. For example, if winning the current contract significantly improves future profitability (e.g., by positioning the vehicle favorably), the decrease from $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ may dominate, but this is not universally true. The example in the paper shows cases where $c_j^*$ increases or decreases depending on the contract type (AB vs. DA) and its impact on future routing flexibility.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The formula does not imply that the optimal bid always decreases as the future profit from winning the current contract ($\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$) increases. Instead, the term $- \\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ suggests that higher future profits would lead to a higher optimal bid, not a lower one.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-1238-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-1238-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly states that higher future profits would lead to a higher optimal bid, which contradicts the formula's implication that the optimal bid decreases with $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$.

The functions ψ1(x), ψ2(x), and ψ3(x) are derived to be convex underestimators of √(x1 + x2^2) over the specified domain. The maximum of these functions, ψ(x), is also a convex function and serves as a tighter underestimator compared to standard factorable relaxations, as demonstrated in the paper's example.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The context does not mention the function ψ(x) = max{ψ1(x), ψ2(x), ψ3(x)}, nor does it discuss whether it is a convex underestimator of √(x1 + x2^2) over [0,5]×[0,2].

Is this statement true?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The projection $z^{*}$ onto $M$ can indeed be expanded as a Fourier series with respect to an orthonormal basis of $M$, where the coefficients $\\alpha_{k}$ are given by the inner product $(b,e_{k})$.

While $M_{k}$ may initially increase slightly as $k$ goes from 2 to 3, it generally becomes a decreasing function of $k$ for larger values. This reflects the trade-off between increased difficulty in identifying the best ad (which would raise $M_{k}$) and the higher sampling costs (which would lower $n^{*}$). The table provided in the paper shows this non-monotonic relationship.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

The proof of Theorem 2 shows that by setting $p=121/229$ and using the transformation defined by matrix $A$, the inequality $(1-p)\\alpha_{i,j}+p\\beta_{i,j} \\leq \\frac{297}{229}$ holds.

The condition $\\alpha_{a} + \\alpha_{b} \\geq c_{x}(a,b)$ is part of the constraints defining the polytope $\\mathcal{F}_{G^{\\ast}}$, but it alone does not ensure extradominance. Extradominance requires additional constraints, such as those involving the weight function $c_{x}(a,b)$ and the specific conditions on the vertices and edges, as detailed in the full set of constraints (7)–(14).
