Explanation: The variance $\\kappa$ is calculated as $\\Sigma\\pi a^{2}$, where $a$ represents the scores. If all scores are zero for certain recessivity types (e.g., $[22^{*}]$ and [4]), then $\\kappa = 0$. This means these types contribute no variability to the linkage test statistic, making them uninformative for detecting linkage.

The denominator includes $r$ and $2 \\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$, meaning that higher $r$ (more variable responses) will decrease the value of $f$, while higher $\\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$ (more fixed responses) will increase the numerator and partially offset the denominator.

While the null model specifies that the response depends only on time and not on any other predictors, the assumption that the selection probability for each predictor should be exactly 1/6 is an ideal scenario.

Is it correct to say that a larger R(X|β) implies X is more representative of Π₀ than Π₁, given the definition of D(x,𝒳ₖ|β)?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: The ratio R(X|β) = D(X,𝒳₁|β)/D(X,𝒳₀|β) measures the relative distance of X to 𝒳₁ compared to 𝒳₀. A larger R(X|β) means X is farther from 𝒳₁ relative to 𝒳₀, implying X is closer to 𝒳₀ and thus more representative of Π₀. However, the question incorrectly states the implication. A larger R(X|β) actually implies X is less representative of Π₁ (not necessarily more representative of Π₀, unless the distances are explicitly compared). The correct interpretation is that a larger R(X|β) suggests X is more likely from Π₀ because it is relatively closer to 𝒳₀.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

The definition of D(x,𝒳ₖ|β) is not explicitly provided, making it impossible to determine the exact relationship between R(X|β) and representativeness, but the assignment rule suggests that a larger R(X|β) indicates X is closer to Π₀ in terms of distance, not necessarily more representative of it in a general sense.\n\nQID: statistic-posneg-1923-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"statistic-posneg-1923-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies that a larger R(X|β) means X is more likely to be assigned to Π₀, but does not directly imply greater representativeness.

The context explicitly states that the GPD distribution function is highly sensitive to the shape parameter $\\xi$, making direct fitting challenging if initial values are not close to the true parameter values.

The paper explicitly shows that for the proportional odds model, the sum of probabilities $p_{ij}$ for each subject is indeed 1, as derived from the cumulative probabilities: $\\sum_{j=1}^J p_{ij} = \\sum_{j=1}^J (\\pi_{ij} - \\pi_{i,j-1}) = \\pi_{iJ} - \\pi_{i0} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This ensures the proportionality of the Poisson and multinomial likelihoods for this model.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The Kummer function $\\Psi(a,b;x)$ does not generally simplify when $b=1$. The specific form used in the derivation, $\\Psi\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\xi}+1,1;\\frac{\\xi(x-u)}{\\lambda}\\Big)$, retains its complexity and is correctly expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions ${_1F_1}$ as shown in the definition. The presence of $\\Gamma(1-b)$ and $\\Gamma(b-1)$ in the definition of $\\Psi$ indicates that the function's behavior is non-trivial at $b=1$, requiring careful handling rather than simplification.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context provides the definition of the Kummer function $\\Psi(a,b;x)$ and when $b=1$, the function reduces to a simpler form because the term $\\Gamma(1-b)$ becomes $\\Gamma(0)$ which is undefined, but the term $\\Gamma(b-1)$ becomes $\\Gamma(0)$ which is also undefined. However, looking at the definition, when $b=1$, the Kummer function $\\Psi(a,b;x)$ simplifies to $\\frac{\\Gamma(1-1)}{\\Gamma(1+a-1)}_{1}F_{1}(a,1;x)+\\frac{\\Gamma(1-1)}{\\Gamma(a)}x^{1-1}_{1}F_{1}(1+a-1,2-1;x)$ which becomes $\\frac{\\Gamma(0)}{\\Gamma(a)}_{1}F_{1}(a,1;x)+\\frac{\\Gamma(0)}{\\Gamma(a)}x^{0}_{1}F_{1}(a,1;x)$. Since $\\Gamma(0)$ is undefined, we look at the series expansion of the confluent hypergeometric function. When $b=1$, the series expansion of ${_1F_{1}}(a,1;x)$ becomes $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(a)_{k}}{(1)_{k}}\\frac{x^{k}}{k!}$ which simplifies to $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(a)_{k}}{k!}\\frac{x^{k}}{k!}$ and further to $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(a)_{k}}{(k!)^{2}}x^{k}$.
