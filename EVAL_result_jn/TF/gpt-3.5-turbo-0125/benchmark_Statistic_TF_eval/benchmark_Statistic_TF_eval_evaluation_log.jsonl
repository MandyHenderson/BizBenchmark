While the fitted distribution matches marginal tail indices ($\\lambda_{1}^{\\mathrm{(max)}}$, $\\lambda_{2}^{\\mathrm{(max)}}$) and moments well, the original Mardia distribution has $\\lambda_{U}=0$ (tail independence), and the fitted model's $\\hat{\\lambda}_{U}$ is not reported.

While the null model specifies that the response depends only on time and not on any other predictors, the assumption that the selection probability for each predictor should be exactly 1/6 is an ideal scenario. In practice, the selection probabilities may deviate from 1/6 due to random variation, especially in finite samples (200 subjects and 1000 iterations in this case). Additionally, the presence of correlated predictors (e.g., $X_4$ and $X_5$ with correlation 0.7) can further skew the selection probabilities, even under the null model. The 1/6 probability is a theoretical benchmark, not a guaranteed empirical result.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The statement is TRUE. The context clearly states that under the null model where the response depends only on time and not on any other predictors, the chance of each predictor being selected as the split variable should be the same.

A larger cutoff $K$ increases the threshold for the difference in deviance between a tree and its pruned subtree. This means that more terminal nodes will be pruned, leading to a smaller estimated context tree and thus a smaller model dimension. This is consistent with the economic intuition that a higher threshold for pruning results in a more parsimonious model.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. A larger cutoff value $K$ leads to more aggressive pruning of the context tree, resulting in a smaller model dimension.

The high $p$-value (0.66) indicates failure to reject the null hypothesis of equal variances, suggesting no significant variance change.

The Koksma–Hlawka inequality is correctly stated as bounding the absolute error by the product of the total variation of the function and the discrepancy of the point set.

The monotonicity assumption $(D(1)\\geq D(0))$ implies that no patient would receive the experimental treatment if assigned to the standard treatment but not if assigned to the experimental treatment (i.e., no defiers). Defiers are defined as patients with $D(1)=0$ and $D(0)=1$, which directly violates the monotonicity assumption.

The context explicitly states that the GPD distribution function is highly sensitive to the shape parameter $\\xi$, making direct fitting challenging if initial values are not close to the true parameter values. This is illustrated by the simulation results in Table 1, where the theoretical GPD values are almost identical (close to 1) when initial $\\xi$ values are far from the true value ($\\xi=2$), rendering the NLS method ineffective.

Calculating $P(Z>\\Phi^{-1}(0.95))$ where $Z\\sim\\mathbb{N}(0.75,1)$ yields 0.185, which matches the empirical size deviation from the nominal 5% level.

The limiting distribution of the rowwise maximum is given by exp(-∫_{0}^{1} exp(-t/σ(x)) dx), which indeed depends on the function σ(x) only through its integral. This integral captures the cumulative effect of the variance function σ(x) over the interval [0,1], and the limiting distribution is determined by this aggregated measure rather than the pointwise values of σ(x).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context indicates that the key result of the paper is the limiting distribution of the maximum, which is derived under the assumption that the variances of the variables converge to a piecewise continuous function.

The confidence interval $\\hat{\\rho} \\pm \\hat{V}^{\\frac{1}{2}} t_{\\gamma/2,2N-4}$ is not exact for small sample sizes. It is derived using Taylor series approximations and is valid only when $\\hat{V} \\ll \\rho^{2}$ (i.e., when the variance is small relative to the true radius).
