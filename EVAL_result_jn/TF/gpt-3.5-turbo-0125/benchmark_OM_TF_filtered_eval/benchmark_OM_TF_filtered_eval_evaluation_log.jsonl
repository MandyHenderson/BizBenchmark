The transition matrix shows that the probability of staying in the first state (platoon/bunched) is 0.75, while the probability of transitioning from the second state (gap) back to the first state is 0.58.

Explanation: The linear model constrains fs ≤ b^(-1) (see context: 'fs ≤ b^(-1)'). Mathematically, as Ts increases, T = a + bTs grows linearly, keeping fs = Ts/T = Ts/(a + bTs) < b^(-1) since lim(Ts→∞) Ts/(a + bTs) = 1/b.

The lemma ensures that the allocation is envy-free and (1/M)-proportional regardless of the relationship between M and n, as long as these conditions are met. The economic implication is that the fairness of the allocation is determined by the total cover number M, not by the number of agents.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The Allocation Lemma states that the resulting allocation is envy-free and (1/M)-proportional when each agent chooses a piece that gives them the highest utility among the m pieces, and the n choices are pairwise disjoint, where M is the total cover number of the cover of C. Therefore, the statement is true based on the provided context.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-2391-2-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-2391-2-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the conditions for the Allocation Lemma and affirms the true statement, aligning with the gold answer's explanation.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-posneg-2391-2-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the conditions for the Allocation Lemma and affirms the true statement, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-posneg-2391-2-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the conditions for the Allocation Lemma and affirms the true statement, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}

Derivation: From d = LN/s, solving for s gives s = LN/d. Since f_MBA is defined as the number of sections taught (s), substituting s = LN/d into f_MBA = s yields f_MBA = LN/d. Economic Intuition: This equivalence reflects the trade-off between student-teacher ratios (d) and faculty resource allocation.

While the paper discusses the application of the stochastic depletion framework to both cardinality and partition matroids, the 2-approximation guarantee in Corollary 6.1 is specifically stated for the cardinality matroid case.

The constraint explicitly requires that all demand nodes (∀i ∈ I) must have at least a 50% probability of receiving a response within the time standard, ensuring basic coverage.

Explanation: Theorem 2(b) provides a lower bound of $1/4n^2$ for proportionality when the pieces must maintain the same fatness ($R$-fat) as the original rectangle. This bound is significantly smaller (worse) than the $1/n$ proportionality achieved in Theorem 2(c), where the fatness of the pieces is allowed to degrade (to $mR$-fat, with $m=\\lceil n^{1/d}\\rceil$). The trade-off is clear: maintaining strict fatness constraints reduces the guaranteed proportionality, while relaxing fatness constraints allows for better proportionality guarantees. The $1/n$ proportionality in Theorem 2(c) is optimal in the sense that it matches the trivial upper bound (each agent getting at least $1/n$ of the total value), whereas the $1/4n^2$ bound in Theorem 2(b) leaves a substantial gap.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The transformation is correct because it ensures that any solution to the 4Sum problem (where $a_{r}+b_{s}+c_{t}+d_{u}=M$) directly translates to a solution in the 2Pair problem (where $a_{r}^{\\prime}+b_{s}^{\\prime}=c_{t}^{\\prime}+d_{u}^{\\prime}$). Specifically, substituting the transformed values into the 2Pair condition yields $K+2a_{r}+K+2b_{s}=2K+2M-2c_{t}-2d_{u}$, which simplifies to $2K+2(a_{r}+b_{s})=2K+2M-2(c_{t}+d_{u})$, and further to $a_{r}+b_{s}=M-(c_{t}+d_{u})$.

Therefore, the solution obtained from this simplified model will always be less than or equal to the true optimal solution value, making it a lower bound.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The statement is correct. In the simplified crew pairing problem (CPP) formulation discussed in the context, the cost of a pairing is indeed approximated solely by the time-away-from-base cost, ignoring other factors like duty costs and minimum guarantee costs. This approximation ensures that the optimal solution value is always a lower bound on the true optimal solution value, not an upper bound as stated in the question.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-1396-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-1396-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the statement as FALSE (contradicting the question's claim of it being TRUE), but their reasoning incorrectly states that the approximation ensures a lower bound, which aligns with the gold answer's correct reasoning.

Since $p_{1}$ is a positive penalty parameter, the term becomes negative when the total demand $x$ exceeds $H_{1}$.

The statement is TRUE based on the provided context. The penalty term $\text{varphi}_{1}(x)$ is designed to encourage the deletion of a customer from a route when the total demand on the route exceeds the high threshold $H_{1}$, as explained in the context: 'if $\boldsymbol{\text{Σ}}_{\text{c}}$ is fixed to one, the model actually represents the best ejection/insertion move.

Does this imply that lane-changing interactions permanently amplify the initial perturbation k_0 in individual lanes?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: While the solutions show K_1 → k_0/2 and K_2 → -k_0/2 as x → ∞, the total system perturbation ∑K_i = K_1 + K_2 = 0, meaning the initial perturbation k_0 is fully redistributed, not amplified. The apparent 'amplification' in individual lanes is an artifact of the redistribution process—lane-changing interactions split the initial perturbation symmetrically between lanes. This preserves mass conservation (no net density change), consistent with the zero row-sums of matrix A. The negative value for K_2 reflects relative density differences, not absolute amplification.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The convergence of density perturbations K_1 and K_2 to equal and opposite values as x → ∞ implies that lane-changing interactions permanently amplify the initial perturbation k_0 in individual lanes.

While the technical definition of the safety factor (SF = ultimate load / allowable design load > 1.0) is correct, the economic implications go beyond this simple ratio. The context emphasizes that the safety factor is not just a fixed technical parameter but a complex function of material properties, structural design, formula assumptions, and the designer's experience.

The round-trip distance function $r_i(x) = d(x,p_i) + d(x,q_i) + k_i$ is continuous on a tree network $T$ because the shortest-path distance function $d(x,y)$ is continuous for any two points $x$ and $y$ on $T$.

The paper states that for N=1, the condition Π₀H*(s) = H*(s+λ) is equivalent to H being a step function at b and Π₀ = e^(-λb). This condition ensures the independence of inter-departure times, which is necessary for them to be renewal. The economic intuition is that a constant service time (b) and an exponential arrival rate (λ) lead to a renewal process for departures.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT.

The condition $U_{1} \\neq V_{1}$ does not necessarily imply $U_{1} \\cap V_{1} = \\emptyset$ in general. However, in the specific context of the Decomposition Algorithm and under the assumptions of strong ASI, strong SND, and consistency properties, Lemma 6 is used to conclude that $U_{1} \\cap V_{1} = \\emptyset$ when $U_{1} \\neq V_{1}$.

The target debt/equity ratio of 1/2 implies that the firm aims to have half as much debt as equity, not twice as much equity as debt. Specifically, if the debt is D and equity is E, the ratio D/E = 1/2 means E = 2D, which is the same as saying the firm aims to have twice as much equity as debt.

The constraint does allow for price adjustments within a range around the market selling price, but the boundaries (r_l and r_u) can vary with lead time and arrival weeks (peak vs. non-peak).

Explanation: If J_b^q ⊆ J_a^h, then all basic columns under g remain available under h (since J_a^h ⊆ J_a^g). Since y^g is dual feasible for (LP^ħ) and the basis remains feasible, no improvement in the objective function is possible.

The Frank-Wolfe subproblem aims to find a direction for improving the current solution by minimizing the linear approximation of the objective function. The condition T^{od} = 0 if L^{od} - d^{od} ≥ 0 and T^{od} = U if L^{od} - d^{od} < 0 ensures that trips are only increased (up to the bound U) when doing so reduces the overall cost (since d^{od} represents the marginal benefit of additional trips).

The paper clearly states that the carriers (followers) minimize their own costs, which include tolls and risk-related costs, when choosing routes.

Explain the economic intuition behind this formula.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The formula is derived correctly under circular symmetry (σ_xh = σ_yh = σ_h, σ_xw = σ_yw = σ_w, ρ_x = ρ_y = ρ). The term (σ_h² + σ_w² - 2ρσ_hσ_w) represents the variance of the difference in home and workplace positions, accounting for their correlation (ρ). The square root transforms this into a standard deviation, and the factor √(π/2) converts it to the mean of the Rayleigh distribution, which describes the magnitude of a bivariate normal vector.

Is this interpretation correct?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: The constraint ∑_{i∈N} a_{i j} x_{j t} ≤ -y_{j t}^0 for final products (j∈F) indicates that the total output of final products (left-hand side, where a_{i j} < 0 for outputs) must not exceed the negative of the sales target (-y_{j t}^0).

The constraint $R=E-k D$ with $R^{*}=0$ approximates the $D/E$ ratio near the target as $D/E=1/k$. However, the paper does not claim that this ratio is maintained under all economic conditions.

Explanation: The all-express system's round-trip time formula is derived by setting hj = 0 (no local run floors) and nj = n (only express run to floor n). The general formula τj = t0 + t1hj + (2/v)⋅nj simplifies to τn = t0 + (2/v)⋅n when hj = 0. The term t0′ = t0 + t1 in the all-express formula accounts for the constant time component plus the time for serving a single floor, but this is not directly derived from the general formula by simply setting hj = 1.

The term $-\\sum_{e\\in B\\cap\\pi}l_{e}(x_{e})$ is context-dependent: it arises from equilibrium conditions where backward edges represent alternative routes with lower mean-variance costs. The actual impact on total social cost depends on the specific network topology, flow distribution, and the trade-off between the $(1+\\gamma\\kappa)$ multiplier on $A$-edges and the unweighted subtraction of $B$-edge latencies. The bound reflects a worst-case scenario under equilibrium constraints, not a guaranteed cost reduction.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The upper bound for the social cost of a risk-averse Wardrop equilibrium provided in the context implies that the presence of backward edges in B always reduces the social cost.

The variance term σ_m is defined as a weighted sum of 𝔼_{k-1}‖V_k - 𝔼_{k-1}(V_k)‖^2, with weights 1/(N-k)^2. For k=1, it corresponds to the variance of V, but as k increases, the weights 1/(N-k)^2 grow larger, emphasizing the maximum deviations (diameter-like measures) over the variance-like measures.

While the formula $E[W_{0}] = \\frac{E[B_{0}]}{\\uplambda_{0}}$ is mathematically correct under Little's Law, the economic principle implies that higher back orders ($E[B_{0}]$) should indeed lead to longer waiting times ($E[W_{0}]$), but this relationship is only valid if the demand rate ($\\uplambda_{0}$) remains constant.

Is this interpretation correct based on the context provided?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The edge capacity constraint $\\sum_{k}\\frac{f_{k}(e,t)}{\\mu_{k}(e)}\\leq1$ does not represent the sum of flow rates of all commodities but rather the sum of the fractions of the maximum possible flow rates (capacities).
