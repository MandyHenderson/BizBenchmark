Explanation: When C ≥ (1 - (α̲/ᾱ))(B - V), the cost of screening is high enough that the bank prefers not to screen any applicants (θ* = 0) and instead randomly rejects applications. Since the bank's policy is not observable, borrowers cannot distinguish between screened and unscreened applications, leading all borrowers (α* = ᾱ) to apply for a loan workout. The bank screens all applicants (k* = 1) because the high screening cost makes it suboptimal to screen only a portion.

Explanation: While higher domestic inflation (π, affecting ρ) can reduce the real value of domestic currency-denominated debt (via the εα(1+ř) term), the overall effect depends on multiple factors: (1) The term (ř - g - ρ(1+g)) shows that inflation only reduces debt if the weighted interest rate ř is less than nominal GDP growth (g + ρ(1+g)). (2) For foreign currency debt (1-α portion), inflation's exchange rate effect (ε) may depreciate local currency, increasing the USD value of debt. (3) The current account adjustment (tb_{t+1}) must also be considered. Thus, inflation's net effect is ambiguous and depends on currency composition (α), interest-growth differentials, and exchange rate passthrough.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The context does not support the claim that higher domestic inflation (π) always reduces the debt burden (d_{t+1} < d_t) in developing economies. The equation provided in the context shows that the relationship between domestic inflation and debt burden is more complex, and the impact of inflation on debt burden depends on various factors, including the change in the domestic GDP deflator (ρ), the domestic interest rate (r_d), and the share of total external debt expressed in domestic currency (α).\n\nQID: finance-posneg-148-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"finance-posneg-148-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies that the claim is false and provides a concise explanation that aligns with the complexity of the factors involved, as detailed in the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "finance-posneg-148-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly identifies that the claim is false and provides a concise explanation that aligns with the complexity of the factors involved, as detailed in the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "finance-posneg-148-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly identifies that the claim is false and provides a concise explanation that aligns with the complexity of the factors involved, as detailed in the gold answer."}

Explain the economic intuition behind this relationship.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The equation shows that the denominator increases with higher risk aversion (Φ), leading to a smaller optimal (A/W).

While the state-by-birth cohort fixed effects control for time-invariant state-level characteristics and cohort-specific shocks that are common to both treatment and control groups, they do not fully eliminate bias from time-varying state-level economic conditions that might differentially affect treatment and control groups. For example, if tuition changes ($Z_{s t}$) are correlated with other state-level economic shocks that directly affect consumer credit outcomes ($Y_{i s t a}$), the estimates could still be biased. The paper addresses this concern by using the control group (non-attendees) to absorb state-level shocks, but the fixed effects alone are not sufficient to guarantee unbiasedness.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

Is it correct to interpret that a higher fraction repurchased $(F_{P})$ would always lead to a more positive market reaction if the premium is positive?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: While the formula does indeed represent a weighted average, the market reaction depends on both the premium and the CAR. A higher fraction repurchased $(F_{P})$ would give more weight to the premium term, but the CAR term could be negative or positive depending on market perception. For example, if the premium is positive but the CAR is negative (indicating a negative market reaction to the repurchase announcement), a higher $(F_{P})$ could still lead to a less positive or even negative overall reaction if the negative CAR dominates. Additionally, the market might interpret a high $(F_{P})$ as a signal of overpayment or financial distress, which could negatively impact the CAR.

Explanation: In cornered equilibria, Lemma 2 establishes that ∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ. For SE (f_b=1), ∂D_S/∂ϕ > 0 implies ∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ > 0, meaning shortening maturity improves both bond values. For LE (f_b=0), ∂D_S/∂ϕ < 0 implies ∂D_S/∂ϕ < ∂D_L/∂ϕ < 0, meaning lengthening improves both bond values. Since equity holders maximize issuance proceeds (which align with bond value improvements in these cases), their actions are locally firm-value-maximizing near default. This local efficiency arises because the maturity structure's impact on bond values is aligned with equity's incentives in cornered equilibria.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. According to the context, near the default boundary, the sensitivity of long-term debt to maturity structure changes is greater than that of short-term debt (∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ), which is consistent with equity holders' maturity structure decisions being locally firm-value-maximizing near the default boundary, as implied by Lemma 2.\n\nQID: finance-posneg-2011-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"finance-posneg-2011-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the key condition (∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ) and aligns with the gold answer's explanation of local firm-value maximization near the default boundary.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "finance-posneg-2011-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the key condition (∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ) and aligns with the gold answer's explanation of local firm-value maximization near the default boundary."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "finance-posneg-2011-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the key condition (∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ) and aligns with the gold answer's explanation of local firm-value maximization near the default boundary."}

Is this statement true given the assumption of zero correlation between dz1 and dz2?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The bond price factorization into P1(x1,t,T)P2(x2,t,T) is valid because the risk-neutral processes for x1 and x2 are driven by independent Brownian motions (dz1 and dz2 with zero correlation). This independence allows the joint distribution of (x1, x2) to be expressed as the product of their marginal distributions, justifying the multiplicative form of the bond price formula.

The bond price formula $P(r,t,T)=A(t,T)e^{-B(t,T)r}$ directly leads to the expression for $R(r,t,T)$ through the definition of the continuously compounded interest rate: $R(r,t,T)=-\\frac{1}{T-t}\\ln P(r,t,T)$.

Explanation: The bid price p is determined by the certainty equivalent w*, which satisfies u(w*) = E{u(w0 + Y)}. If two utility functions u1 and u2 are affine transformations of each other (i.e., u2(w) = a u1(w) + b with a > 0, b ∈ R), they represent the same preferences and yield the same certainty equivalent w* and thus the same bid price p.

Is this statement true, and what is the economic rationale behind this regulation?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The statement is partially correct but misleading. While it is true that higher risk-weighted assets (higher $w$) require more equity capital (higher $V_{B E}$), the capital requirement $h$ is not held constant. The formula $V_{B E}\\geq V_{B}\\times w\\times h$ shows that $V_{B E}$ must be proportional to both $w$ and $h$. The economic rationale is to ensure banks hold sufficient capital to absorb losses proportional to the riskiness of their assets ($w$) and the regulatory minimum ($h$). However, the statement incorrectly implies that $h$ remains unchanged when $w$ increases, which is not necessarily the case. The regulation aims to align capital holdings with asset risk, but the requirement $h$ is a fixed regulatory parameter, not a variable adjusted for $w$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The key distinction is that H(t+x) - H(t) = ∫ₜ^{t+x} h(u)du depends on the nonhomogeneous hazard rate h(.), making the distribution time-dependent. The Markovian property here refers to the process's dependence only on the current state N(t) = n, not on past history—not memorylessness of waiting times.

Does this formula imply that the interest rate is always higher when the developing country's technology growth rate $\\dot{a}_{B t}$ is positive?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The impact of $\\dot{a}_{B t}$ on $r_{t}$ depends on the denominator $c_{T B t}+c_{T A t}$. If tradable consumption in both countries is sufficiently high, the term $\\frac{\\dot{a}_{B t}}{c_{T B t}+c_{T A t}}$ becomes small, and the interest rate may not increase significantly even with positive technology growth.

Justify your answer with reference to the paper's simulation design.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The formula σ²_η = (1-ρ²)σ²(α)/ρ² is used to scale the variance of the characteristic-sorted portfolio alphas (η) based on the squared correlation ρ² between the sorting characteristic and estimated alphas (α̂). However, under the null hypothesis where true alphas are zero, σ²(α) should only reflect sampling variability (δ̂_i² + 1 terms).

The asymptotic variance of the local Whittle (LW) estimator is indeed 1/4 for non-perturbed fractional processes, as shown by Robinson (1995a). However, for perturbed fractional processes, the presence of an additive noise term (with long-run noise-to-signal ratio θρ) affects the estimator's properties.

The paper states that it models step options as a modification of barrier options where the knock-out provision is regularized by introducing a finite knock-out rate ρ, which implies that the delta of a step option is continuous at the barrier for any finite knock-out rate ρ.\n\nQID: finance-posneg-4375-0-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"finance-posneg-4375-0-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the continuity of delta at the barrier for step options with a finite knock-out rate ρ, aligning with the gold answer's explanation.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "finance-posneg-4375-0-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the continuity of delta at the barrier for step options with a finite knock-out rate ρ, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "finance-posneg-4375-0-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the continuity of delta at the barrier for step options with a finite knock-out rate ρ, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}

The paper demonstrates that at high levels of structural uncertainty (e.g., σ = 762.50% vs. 766.50%), small changes in σ lead to dramatic shifts in both the risk-free return (from 6.68% to -5.28%) and the equity premium (from 1.28% to 13.24%).

While higher trading activity (higher $B_{i,j}$) generally reduces the duration because it increases the denominator $H_{i,j} + B_{i,j}$, the effect depends on the timing and magnitude of the trades. If the trades are concentrated towards the end of the window ($t$ close to $T-1$), the term $(T-t-1)\\alpha_{i,j,t}$ will be small, reducing the impact on the duration.

While the positive coefficient (2.36) and significant t-statistic (5.49) for lnPV suggest a positive relationship between P/V ratios and first-day returns, this does not necessarily imply underpricing. The P/V ratio itself is a measure of valuation relative to fundamentals, and a high P/V could reflect either mispricing (overpricing) or justified high growth expectations.

Explanation: Under perfect competition, the firm's profit π̃ is given by π̃ = p̃q - C(q) - F, where p̃ is the stochastic price, q is the deterministic output, C(q) is the variable cost, and F is the fixed cost. Since C(q) and F are non-stochastic, their covariances with R̃ₘ are zero. Thus, Cov(R̃ₘ, π̃) = Cov(R̃ₘ, p̃q) = q Cov(R̃ₘ, p̃), as q is not stochastic. This simplification is valid only under perfect competition where the firm is a price taker and does not influence the price distribution.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The inequality ξ_t^i ≥ E[ξ_T^i | ϕ_t] holds because the normalized stock price ξ_t^i ≡ ζ_t^i Y_t^i is defined as the product of the state price density ζ_t^i and the stock price Y_t^i. Given that stock prices and dividend yields are non-negative, and considering the properties of the state price density, the normalized stock price must satisfy the supermartingale condition under the actual measure.

Explanation: The term δₜ[cₜ - Eₜ₋₁(sₜ)] shows that δₜ measures the weight of the central parity deviation in explaining exchange rate surprises. However, higher δₜ indicates greater credibility, meaning markets trust the central parity (e.g., a peg) more. Thus, sₜ becomes less sensitive to cₜ - Eₜ₋₁(sₜ) because δₜ acts as a stabilizing coefficient. High credibility (δₜ → 1) anchors expectations (Eₜ₋₁(sₜ) ≈ cₜ), reducing volatility. The random shock uₜ dominates when δₜ is low (low credibility), making sₜ more volatile.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The model, trained on 1977-1989 data, would not account for the sudden loss of Drexel's market power and the entry of commercial banks, which likely led to increased competition and lower fees.

The formula itself does not impose $R \\leq r$; it is derived under the assumption that $P_{R} = P_{C}$. The no-arbitrage condition $R \\leq r$ arises from the cost-of-carry relationship $P_{C} = P^{*}(1+r)$, which, when combined with the formula for $P^{*}$, leads to $r = R$ if the cost-of-carry formula holds.

Explanation: The condition $B(y) < D_i^{rf} = 1$ implies that the liquidation value $B(y)$ is less than the risk-free value of both short-term and long-term debt. Since debt holders have equal seniority and the total face value is normalized to 1, all debt holders receive $B(y)$ per unit of face value in bankruptcy. Because $B(y) < 1$, there is a positive loss-given-default for bondholders, and equity holders, who are residual claimants, recover nothing ($B(y)$ is entirely allocated to debt holders).
