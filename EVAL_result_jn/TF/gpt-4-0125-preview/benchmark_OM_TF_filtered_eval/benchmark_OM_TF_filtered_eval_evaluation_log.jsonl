True or False?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. While the adaptive greedy algorithm $A G(A^{m},\\underline{{{r}}})$ yields Gittins indices for the priority class $\\Sigma_{m}$, these indices are not entirely independent of other priority classes.

Derivation: From d = LN/s, solving for s gives s = LN/d. Since f_MBA is defined as the number of sections taught (s), substituting s = LN/d into f_MBA = s yields f_MBA = LN/d. Economic Intuition: This equivalence reflects the trade-off between student-teacher ratios (d) and faculty resource allocation.

The T² control chart involves modeling five unknown parameters (μ1, μ2, and the elements of ∑) and treats the population covariance matrix as unknown, unlike the X chart which typically models only one parameter (the population mean) and assumes a known population variance. This increased complexity and uncertainty necessitate larger sample sizes to achieve reliable estimates and control limits.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The equation can be rearranged as $$x_{j} - x_{j+1} = (k_{j+1} - k_{j})x_{p k}$$, which shows that the difference in factor weights ($$x_{j} - x_{j+1}$$) is proportional to the difference in importance rankings ($$k_{j+1} - k_{j}$$) with the proportionality constant $$x_{p k}$$.

This is supported by the explanation that the two policies disagree on certain requests, such as class (2), where the BPC policy accepts but the CEC policy rejects.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-1982-5-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-1982-5-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer incorrectly states 'TRUE' when the gold answer clearly indicates 'FALSE'.

The assumption of linear effectiveness is questionable because future disease prevalence depends on the success of current treatments, and the contagious nature of tuberculosis means that the effectiveness of treatments in preventing future cases is not linearly proportional to the number of treatments allocated. The model simplifies this relationship, but in reality, the impact of treatments on future cases is likely non-linear due to the complex dynamics of disease transmission.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The context explicitly states that 'the assumption of linear effectiveness is questionable' due to the contagious nature of tuberculosis and the dependency of future disease prevalence on current treatment success, indicating that the linear programming model's assumption is not justified.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-34-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-34-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the falsity of the linear effectiveness assumption and accurately references the contagious nature of tuberculosis and the dependency of future prevalence on current treatments, aligning perfectly with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-posneg-34-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the falsity of the linear effectiveness assumption and accurately references the contagious nature of tuberculosis and the dependency of future prevalence on current treatments, aligning perfectly with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-posneg-34-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the falsity of the linear effectiveness assumption and accurately references the contagious nature of tuberculosis and the dependency of future prevalence on current treatments, aligning perfectly with the gold answer."}

Is it true that minimizing this function leads to a user-optimized equilibrium where no user can reduce their travel cost by unilaterally changing routes?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The function $Z(\\mathbf{V})$ is known as the Beckmann transformation, and its minimization is mathematically equivalent to finding a Wardrop equilibrium (user-optimized equilibrium) under the assumption that $C_a(v)$ is non-decreasing. This is because the first-order optimality conditions of the minimization problem correspond to Wardrop's principle: for any used path between an origin-destination pair, the travel costs are equal and minimal. The integral form ensures that the marginal cost of increasing flow on a link (which affects all users on that link) is properly accounted for in the optimization, aligning individual user incentives with system-wide efficiency under equilibrium conditions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

Based on the output equation Ŷ_S = Γ - [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] * D̂, is this claim mathematically supported by the formula, and what is the economic mechanism?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Mathematical Support: The output loss depends on the multiplier term [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] applied to the negative shock D̂. Assuming stability (denominator > 0), as κ increases, the term (μ+κγ_D) increases, making the denominator (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) smaller. This increases the magnitude of the entire fraction, thus amplifying the negative impact of D̂ on Ŷ_S. Economic Mechanism: Higher price flexibility (larger κ) means that a given negative output gap (Ŷ_S < 0) leads to a larger fall in prices (more negative π_S). Due to Fisherian debt deflation (nominal debts), falling prices increase the real debt burden for borrowers. This forces them to cut spending even more drastically, exacerbating the initial contraction. The debt-deflation channel dominates any potential benefits of faster price adjustment in this specific ZLB context.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The formula Ŷ_S = Γ - [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] * D̂ mathematically supports the claim that increased price flexibility (higher κ) worsens output contraction (lower Ŷ_S) at the ZLB after a deleveraging shock D̂. As κ increases, the denominator (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) decreases, amplifying the negative impact of D̂ on Ŷ_S.

The condition $\\bar{e}_{0} \\leq \\bar{l}_{0}$ ensures that the earliest departure time does not exceed the latest departure time, which is necessary for feasibility but does not directly enforce the 16-hour shift limit. The shift limit is enforced through the calculation of $\\bar{e}_{0} = \\operatorname*{max}(e_{0}, \\bar{e}_{n+1} - S)$ and $\\bar{l}_{n+1} = \\operatorname*{min}(\\dot{l}_{n+1}, \\bar{l_{0}} + S)$, where $S$ represents the shift time limit.

The paper shows that for $B > 1$, $f(x)$ is strictly convex ($f''(x) > 0$) and monotonically increasing, while $g(x)$ is linear. Since $f(0) = g(0) = \\alpha$ and $g'(0) > f'(0)$, the two functions can intersect at most once in (0,1). This ensures the equation $d(\\ln C(x))/dx = 0$ (which reduces to $f(x) = g(x)$) has a unique solution, guaranteeing a single optimal capacity increment size $x^*$.

A smaller ||ū|| indicates that d is closer to the range space of A, allowing a larger step α without significantly distorting the polyhedron X.

The model does not minimize all deviation variables equally. The objective function Z = P1(d^t-) + P2(d^r+) + P3(d^t+) + P4(d^t+) includes priority weights (P1, P2, P3, P4) that assign different importance to each type of deviation. For example, P1(d^t-) prioritizes minimizing negative deviations from finished product targets, while P2(d^r+) focuses on minimizing positive deviations from resource constraints. The economic implication is that the model allows for trade-offs between different goals (e.g., meeting production targets vs. avoiding resource overutilization) based on their assigned priorities.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

While the preference list configuration for $u_{\\ell}$ (with $v_{\\ell}$ as top choice and $s$ as second choice) is part of the design, the necessity stems from ensuring that the matching problem's solution corresponds to a satisfying assignment.

Is it correct to say that this probability decreases if the error variance $\\sigma_{s}$ increases, holding all other parameters constant?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. Explanation: The probit function $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. An increase in $\\sigma_{s}$ (the standard deviation of the error term) decreases the argument of $\\Phi(\\cdot)$, which is $\\frac{c_{s}+\\sum_{t=1}^{T}a_{s t}b_{j t}}{\\sigma_{s}}$. Since $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is monotonically increasing, a smaller argument leads to a smaller probability.

The specific order (top and second choice) is a design choice to facilitate the reduction, but alternative preference orderings could also work as long as they maintain the logical structure of the clause.

While the kinematic wave speed $w(x,t)$ is generally positive in uncongested conditions and negative in congested conditions, this is not always the case. The critical density marks the boundary between uncongested and congested flow states, and at this point, the kinematic wave speed is stationary (zero).

While the technical definition of the safety factor (SF = ultimate load / allowable design load > 1.0) is correct, the economic implications go beyond this simple ratio. The context emphasizes that the safety factor is not just a fixed technical parameter but a complex function of material properties, structural design, formula assumptions, and the designer's experience.

Is it true that these constraints ensure the total weight and volume from passengers and cargo do not exceed the aircraft's capacity?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. While constraints (17) and (18) do consider the weight and volume from passengers and their baggage, they are specifically modified versions of constraints (6) and (7) from the cargo mix bid price model. Their primary role is to link the passenger and cargo models by incorporating passenger-related weight and volume into the cargo capacity constraints, not to directly enforce the aircraft's total capacity limits. The standard leg-based fleeting constraints (12)–(14) are responsible for ensuring the aircraft's total capacity is not exceeded.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT. The context mentions that the integrated passenger-cargo fleeting model links passenger and cargo capacities through variables and constraints involving payload and belly volume, but it does not explicitly state whether constraints (17) and (18) ensure that the total weight and volume from passengers and cargo do not exceed the aircraft's capacity.

Does this assumption hold in real-world scenarios where vehicles might have varying service rates or preferences?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. In real-world scenarios, vehicles might have varying service rates, preferences, or other operational constraints that could lead to uneven workload distribution. The model's assumption of even splitting simplifies the problem but may not fully capture the complexities of actual emergency service operations.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nCANNOT_DETERMINE.

While the number of potential crossings indeed scales with N(N-1) (since each of the N paths can cross with N-1 others), the crossings intensity formula itself is based on flow densities q(w), which are already normalized per trip.

The condition $\\bar{\\mu}{\\binom{e}{0}}-{\\binom{0}{1}}\\in C^{*}$ is derived from the definition of $\\bar{\\mu} = v(\\mathrm{II}.C^{*}) + \\epsilon$, where $v(\\mathrm{II}.C^{*})$ is the optimal value of problem $(\\mathrm{II}-C^{*})$. This inclusion in $C^{*}$ is part of the contradiction argument showing that $\\bar{\\mu}$ cannot be strictly better than the infimum $\\mu$ for problem (II), thus confirming optimality (no duality gap).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The formula includes the sum of tracking, aiming, and firing times (RT + TM + TF) for each iteration, but the context does not clearly specify whether these components are repeated for each iteration or if they are one-time components.

While increasing ω reduces the second component (A²)/(2ω), the first component (F - A T) is independent of ω. If (F - A T) is positive and large, the total delay D may still be significant even with a high ω. The overall delay reduction depends on the relative magnitudes of both components. The paper's context suggests that for small service times, the queueing delay is nearly equal to the processing time, but the arrival pattern's impact (first component) remains a critical factor.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The equation D = (F - A T) + (A²)/(2ω) shows that the term (A²)/(2ω) is inversely proportional to the service rate ω. As ω increases, this term decreases, which reduces the total delay D.

The constraint $R=E-k D$ with $R^{*}=0$ approximates the $D/E$ ratio near the target as $D/E=1/k$. However, the paper does not claim that this ratio is maintained under all economic conditions. The model is nonstationary due to time-variant matrices $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, which make the system sensitive to economic fluctuations and product-market development cycles. Thus, the $D/E$ ratio may vary as economic conditions change, and the constraint only ensures approximation near the target.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

Explanation: The all-express system's round-trip time formula is derived by setting hj = 0 (no local run floors) and nj = n (only express run to floor n). The general formula τj = t0 + t1hj + (2/v)⋅nj simplifies to τn = t0 + (2/v)⋅n when hj = 0. The term t0′ = t0 + t1 in the all-express formula accounts for the constant time component plus the time for serving a single floor, but this is not directly derived from the general formula by simply setting hj = 1. The correct interpretation is that the all-express system eliminates the local run term (hj = 0), and the constant term is adjusted to include the time for serving a single floor.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explains that the round-trip time formula for the all-express system, where each elevator serves only a single floor, is derived by redefining the variables $h_j$ and $n_j$ in the general formula. Specifically, $h_j$ is set to 1 (single floor per elevator) and $n_j$ is set to $n$ (the floor number), resulting in the formula $\tau_n = t_0' + (2/v) \times n$, where $t_0' = t_0 + t_1$.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-1178-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-1178-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer incorrectly states that the all-express system's formula is derived by setting hj = 1.

Is this interpretation correct?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: The constraint ∑_{i∈N} a_{i j} x_{j t} ≤ -y_{j t}^0 for final products (j∈F) indicates that the total output of final products (left-hand side, where a_{i j} < 0 for outputs) must not exceed the negative of the sales target (-y_{j t}^0).

The constraint ∑_{i∈N} a_{i j} x_{j t} ≤ -y_{j t}^0 for j∈F represents a sales constraint, and since a_{i j} < 0 indicates outputs, increasing y_{j t}^0 (sales target) makes the right-hand side of the inequality more negative.

For a continuous supermodular function $\\phi$, the optimal value of the multivariate Monge-Kantorovich problem is indeed given by this integral. This result follows from Theorem 5 (Lorentz [21] and Theorem 5 in Tchen [42]), which provides an explicit solution to the optimal transport problem for supermodular functions, expressed in terms of the generalized inverses of the marginal distribution functions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT. The context mentions optimal transport and stochastic order concepts being used in the characterization of a limiting relaxation, but it does not provide any specific information about supermodular functions or the exact form of the optimal value of the multivariate Monge-Kantorovich problem.

The modified cost matrix $(\\hat{C}_{L})_{\\ell i}$ assigns a cost of 0.1 for trucks on highways ($i \\in \\mathcal{H}$) and 0.7 for trucks on small roads ($i \\in \\mathcal{E} \\setminus \\mathcal{H}$). This higher cost on small roads indeed incentivizes trucks to avoid them, but the cost on highways (0.1) is not lower than the cost on small roads (0.7); rather, it is significantly higher than the cost for cars on any road (0.1). The phrasing 'lower cost to highways' is misleading because the cost on highways is the same as for cars on any road.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT.

While the condition shows that the supremum of the difference between $f$ and $f_k$ over $S$ converges to zero, it does not necessarily imply uniform convergence. The given condition is a pointwise convergence result, and uniform convergence would require additional constraints on the behavior of $f_k$ across all points in $S$ simultaneously.

The paper explicitly states that substituting variables in the matching problem's linear program yields a relaxation of the HK linear program, leading to M ≤ HK/2. This inequality implies β_HK(d) ≥ 2β_M(d) when considering the asymptotic behavior of these quantities scaled by n^{(d-1)/d}.

Lemma 6.7's conclusion (μ^3t ≥^m μ^1k ∨ μ^2l) depends critically on the NA condition and the connectedness of payoff sets. The proof uses a non-trivial construction of auxiliary sets (e.g., Ǔ) and their containment relationships, which may fail if U_μ lacks the required structure (e.g., in the Figure 3 example where projections are not regular).

Is this interpretation correct?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The constraint $(\\sum A_i \\text{ADA}_i)X - 0.500T \\geq 0$ actually ensures that local funds cover at least 50% of total costs ($L \\geq 0.5T$). However, the paper later specifies $\\alpha_1 = 0.629$ and $\\alpha_2 = 0.37$ as bounds for local and state shares, indicating the 50% constraint is a simplified or initial condition, not the final model's requirement.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT.

While $M_{k}$ may initially increase slightly as $k$ goes from 2 to 3, it generally becomes a decreasing function of $k$ for larger values. This reflects the trade-off between increased difficulty in identifying the best ad (which would raise $M_{k}$) and the higher sampling costs (which would lower $n^{*}$). The table provided in the paper shows this non-monotonic relationship.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nCANNOT_DETERMINE. The context provides the formula for the optimal sample size and mentions the multiplication constant $M_{k}$, but it does not provide any information about how $M_{k}$ behaves as the number of tested ads ($k$) increases. Without additional details about the relationship between $M_{k}$ and $k$, it is impossible to determine whether $M_{k}$ always increases with $k$.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-3027-1-3\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-3027-1-3\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer incorrectly states that the behavior of $M_{k}$ cannot be determined, while the gold answer clearly explains that $M_{k}$ generally decreases with larger $k$ and provides reasoning for this trend.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-posneg-3027-1-3", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer incorrectly states that the behavior of $M_{k}$ cannot be determined, while the gold answer clearly explains that $M_{k}$ generally decreases with larger $k$ and provides reasoning for this trend."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-posneg-3027-1-3", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer incorrectly states that the behavior of $M_{k}$ cannot be determined, while the gold answer clearly explains that $M_{k}$ generally decreases with larger $k$ and provides reasoning for this trend."}

The context explicitly states that with the assumption that the discrete choice can be represented by a binary logit model structure, Hay derived a closed form solution for E[ζk|r], which is used in Equation 6 to correct for selectivity bias. This term is calculated as ρ(σζ/σε)πkr, where πkr is derived from the binary logit probabilities Pkr.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nCANNOT_DETERMINE.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-posneg-1238-0-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nIn the VRPCE model, the optimal bid for contract $s_j$ is given by $c_j^* = c(s_j) - \\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1) + \\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^0)$. Is it true that this formula implies the optimal bid always decreases as the future profit from winning the current contract ($\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$) increases?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. The formula shows that the optimal bid $c_j^*$ decreases with $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ but increases with $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^0)$. The net effect depends on the relative magnitudes of these future profit terms. For example, if winning the current contract significantly improves future profitability (e.g., by positioning the vehicle favorably), the decrease from $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ may dominate, but this is not universally true. The example in the paper shows cases where $c_j^*$ increases or decreases depending on the contract type (AB vs. DA) and its impact on future routing flexibility.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The formula $c_j^* = c(s_j) - \\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1) + \\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^0)$ shows that the optimal bid $c_j^*$ decreases as $\\pi_{j+1}(s_{j+1} \\mid z_j^1)$ increases, since this term is subtracted.

The claim is partially correct but oversimplified. While the convergence $\\mu_{\\tau_{i_{k}}}[0,t]\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}[0,t]-\\mu^{-}[0,t]$ holds for continuity points of $|\\bar{v}|(t)$, weak convergence requires this to hold for all Borel sets, not just intervals $[0,t]$. The context explicitly states this convergence is valid only at continuity points of $|\\bar{v}|(t)$, and the full weak convergence is derived from the relative compactness of $\\mu_{\\tau}^{+}$ and $\\mu_{\\tau}^{-}$ and their domination by $d|\\bar{v}|(t)$. The final conclusion about $\\mu_{\\tau}$ converging weakly to $m_{v}(\\chi\\cdot I[0,t])$ is justified by the subsequence argument and the uniqueness of the limit, but the initial claim lacks these nuances.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explains that for any sequence of $\tau_{i}$, a subsequence can be extracted such that $\\mu_{\tau_{i_{k}}}^{+}$ and $\\mu_{\tau_{i_{k}}}^{-}$ converge weakly to $\\mu^{+}$ and $\\mu^{-}$, respectively. The weak convergence of these measures then implies that $\\mu_{\tau}[0,t] \rightarrow m_{v}(\\chi \\cdot I[0,t])$, supporting the claim.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-1109-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-1109-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the weak convergence of subsequences but oversimplifies the conditions for weak convergence, missing the nuance about continuity points and Borel sets mentioned in the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-posneg-1109-0-0", "category": "PARTIALLY_CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the weak convergence of subsequences but oversimplifies the conditions for weak convergence, missing the nuance about continuity points and Borel sets mentioned in the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-posneg-1109-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "PARTIALLY_CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the weak convergence of subsequences but oversimplifies the conditions for weak convergence, missing the nuance about continuity points and Borel sets mentioned in the gold answer."}

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-posneg-483-2-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nIn the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the equation $A w = n w$ implies that the weight vector $w$ is an eigenvector of the pairwise comparison matrix $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $n$. Is this statement true, and does it hold under the condition that $A$ is consistent and reciprocal?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. While the statement correctly identifies $w$ as an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to eigenvalue $n$, it incorrectly implies that this holds only under the condition that $A$ is consistent and reciprocal. In reality, the equation $A w = n w$ holds by construction of the pairwise comparison matrix $A$, regardless of whether $A$ is consistent or not. The consistency condition $a_{jk} = a_{ik}/a_{ij}$ is a stronger property that ensures the matrix $A$ is perfectly consistent in its pairwise comparisons, but the eigenvalue problem $A w = n w$ is derived directly from the definition of $A$ as a matrix of pairwise ratios, which inherently satisfies the reciprocal property $a_{ji} = 1/a_{ij}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explains that the equation $A w = n w$ implies that $w$ is an eigenvector of the pairwise comparison matrix $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $n$. It also states that $A$ is consistent and reciprocal, satisfying properties such as $a_{ji} = 1/a_{ij}$ and $a_{jk} = a_{ik}/a_{ij}$. These conditions ensure that $A$ has unit rank, making $n$ the only nonzero eigenvalue, and $w$ is the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nQID: Management-posneg-483-2-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-posneg-483-2-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly affirms the statement as true, misinterpreting the conditions under which the equation holds.
