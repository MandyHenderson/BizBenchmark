The warning limits (μ ± 1.25σ/√5) are indeed narrower than the action limits (μ ± 3.00σ/√5).

The context states that nonlinear additive autoregressive models are a natural simplification introduced to address the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional nonparametric autoregressive models.

Explanation: The context explicitly states that T* (not T) is the robust statistic, maintaining its asymptotic χ² distribution under broader conditions (independence of Y and Z with finite variances for s₁(Y) and t₁(Z)).

Is it correct to say that this function prioritizes tests with higher proportions of fixed responses (either positive or negative) over those with higher proportions of variable responses?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The function $f(p, q, r)$ is designed to maximize the value based on the minimum of $p$ and $q$ (fixed responses) relative to the term involving $r$ (variable responses). The denominator includes $r$ and $2 \\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$, meaning that higher $r$ (more variable responses) will decrease the value of $f$, while higher $\\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$ (more fixed responses) will increase the numerator and partially offset the denominator.

The function's numerator is min(p, q), directly increasing with higher fixed responses (p or q).

Explanation: The decomposition formula $\\mathbf{T}=G^{-1/2}\\mathbf{N}$ shows that all components of $\\mathbf{T}$ share the same scaling factor $G^{-1/2}$, where $G\\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\nu/2,\\nu/2)$. This creates a common stochastic volatility effect across all dimensions of $\\mathbf{T}$. Even when $R=I_{d\\times d}$ (no linear correlation), the shared $G$ induces tail dependence - extreme values in one component tend to co-occur with extremes in others because they are all scaled by the same heavy-tailed random variable.

The strength of this dependence increases as $\\nu$ decreases because lower degrees of freedom make the $t$-distribution's tails heavier, amplifying the common shock effect of $G$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

While β2 = 0 indicates no differential subgroup effect on the hazard rate (i.e., the hazard ratio does not vary by subgroup), it does not necessarily imply the absence of subgroups. The subgroups could still exist (ξi = 0 or 1) but have identical hazard ratios (β2 = 0).

Explanation: The paper shows that the correct asymptotic distribution under Gamma-distributed data is $\\mathbb{N}(0.75,1)$, not $\\mathbb{N}(0,1)$ as assumed in [8]. Calculating $P(Z>\\Phi^{-1}(0.95))$ where $Z\\sim\\mathbb{N}(0.75,1)$ yields 0.185, which matches the empirical size deviation from the nominal 5% level. This occurs because the test's critical region is based on the incorrect $\\mathbb{N}(0,1)$ assumption, leading to over-rejection when the true distribution has a mean shift (0.75). The table data confirms this with LW test sizes around 0.1 for Gamma vectors, systematically higher than the CZZ test's sizes closer to 0.05.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

Explanation: While the GPD has a threshold stability property (i.e., if exceedances over $u$ follow a GPD, then exceedances over any higher threshold $u' > u$ also follow a GPD with the same $\\xi$ but rescaled $\\psi$), this is an asymptotic result. In finite samples, $\\xi$ estimates can vary with $u$ due to bias-variance trade-offs: too low $u$ introduces non-extreme observations, distorting $\\xi$; too high $u$ leaves few exceedances, increasing estimation variance. The context emphasizes that threshold selection requires balancing these aspects, implying $u$'s choice can empirically impact $\\xi$ estimates despite theoretical stability.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context states that the generalized Pareto distribution has threshold stability properties, meaning that above a sufficiently high threshold, the shape parameter ξ remains consistent. This stability property ensures that ξ is theoretically invariant to the choice of threshold u once the threshold is high enough for the asymptotic approximation to hold, as required by the PoT framework.\n\nQID: statistic-posneg-861-0-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"statistic-posneg-861-0-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly assumes that the shape parameter ξ is always invariant to the choice of threshold u due to threshold stability.

Explanation: While the paper states that the negative binomial fit is 'slightly better,' the provided metrics do not directly support this. P=0.951 indicates a high probability that the observed data fits the negative binomial model, but without the corresponding P-value for the Poisson-Exponential sum (only χ²=5.88 is given), a direct comparison is not possible. Additionally, the χ² value alone does not indicate goodness-of-fit without degrees of freedom or P-value context. The claim of 'better fit' is thus not fully substantiated by the presented metrics.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.
