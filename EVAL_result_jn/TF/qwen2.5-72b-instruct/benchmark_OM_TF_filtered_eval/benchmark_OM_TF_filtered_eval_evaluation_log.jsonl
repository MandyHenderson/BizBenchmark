The formula for k_ι = μ_1ι/μ_2 = θ_ι(1-ρ)/ρ shows that brand loyalty (ρ) does have an effect on market penetration, as it appears in the denominator.

While condition (ii) is necessary for concavity, it is not sufficient by itself. The proof shows that both conditions (i) and (ii) must hold simultaneously for the game to be concave. Condition (i) requires that the matroid (M, w) has no all-negative circuits, which is also essential.

Explanation: The criterion $$\\mathrm{maximum}\\ [\\alpha h_{i,j}+\\beta\\mid p_{i,j}^{k}\\mid]$$ shows that a higher $\\alpha$ increases the weight of savings ($h_{i,j}(X)$) in the maximization, while a higher $\\beta$ increases the weight of regret ($\\mid p_{i,j}^{k}\\mid$). Therefore, setting $\\alpha > \\beta$ would actually prioritize maximizing savings over minimizing regret, not the other way around.

While the paper hypothesizes an inverse relationship between WIP and loss rate, the formula itself does not imply this relationship. The formula simply defines productivity loss as the ratio of idle operation time to total operation time. The inverse relationship is based on empirical observations and modeling assumptions (minimum loss rate, maximum loss rate, and decreasing factor), not the formula itself. Additionally, the paper acknowledges that more than 40 other factors can impact the loss rate, which means the relationship is not strictly deterministic as implied by the question.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE.

Is it correct to say that this probability decreases if the error variance $\\sigma_{s}$ increases, holding all other parameters constant?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. Explanation: The probit function $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. An increase in $\\sigma_{s}$ (the standard deviation of the error term) decreases the argument of $\\Phi(\\cdot)$, which is $\\frac{c_{s}+\\sum_{t=1}^{T}a_{s t}b_{j t}}{\\sigma_{s}}$. Since $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is monotonically increasing, a smaller argument leads to a smaller probability. Thus, higher error variance reduces the probability of engagement, all else equal.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The probability is given by the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, Φ, applied to the expression (c_s + ∑_{t=1}^T a_{st} b_{jt}) / σ_s.

The equation can be rearranged as $$x_{j} - x_{j+1} = (k_{j+1} - k_{j})x_{p k}$$, which shows that the difference in factor weights ($$x_{j} - x_{j+1}$$) is proportional to the difference in importance rankings ($$k_{j+1} - k_{j}$$) with the proportionality constant $$x_{p k}$$.

Mathematical Support: The output loss depends on the multiplier term [ χ_b / (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) ] applied to the negative shock D̂. Assuming stability (denominator > 0), as κ increases, the term (μ+κγ_D) increases, making the denominator (1-χ_b(μ+κγ_D)) smaller. This increases the magnitude of the entire fraction, thus amplifying the negative impact of D̂ on Ŷ_S. Economic Mechanism: Higher price flexibility (larger κ) means that a given negative output gap (Ŷ_S < 0) leads to a larger fall in prices (more negative π_S). Due to Fisherian debt deflation (nominal debts), falling prices increase the real debt burden for borrowers.

Explanation: Theorem 2(b) provides a lower bound of $1/4n^2$ for proportionality when the pieces must maintain the same fatness ($R$-fat) as the original rectangle. This bound is significantly smaller (worse) than the $1/n$ proportionality achieved in Theorem 2(c), where the fatness of the pieces is allowed to degrade (to $mR$-fat, with $m=\\lceil n^{1/d}\\rceil$). The trade-off is clear: maintaining strict fatness constraints reduces the guaranteed proportionality, while relaxing fatness constraints allows for better proportionality guarantees.

The context states that container failures and loading/unloading accidents result in significantly smaller release quantities (4% and 3% respectively) compared to traffic accidents (40%). Additionally, these events tend to do far less damage due to the absence of hazards like heat and pressure. Therefore, as a close approximation, the first term (traffic accidents) can be considered dominant, and the second term (container failures and loading/unloading accidents) can be neglected entirely.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

Is it correct to say that this term is always less than or equal to $V(s_{i j})$ due to the discount factor $\\gamma$ being between 0 and 1 and $d_{i j}$ being a positive duration?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. While the discount factor $\\gamma$ is typically between 0 and 1, the term $\\gamma^{d_{i j}}V(s_{i j})$ is not necessarily less than or equal to $V(s_{i j})$ because $V(s_{i j})$ could be negative. For example, if the future state $s_{i j}$ has a negative value (indicating a less desirable state for the driver), multiplying by $\\gamma^{d_{i j}}$ (a positive value less than 1) would actually make the term less negative, i.e., $\\gamma^{d_{i j}}V(s_{i j}) > V(s_{i j})$. Thus, the statement is only true if $V(s_{i j})$ is non-negative.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context specifies that the discount factor \\(\\gamma\\) is between 0 and 1, and \\(d_{ij}\\) is a positive duration. Since raising a number between 0 and 1 to a positive power results in a smaller number, \\(\\gamma^{d_{ij}}\\) is always less than or equal to 1.

The statement is false because if e2' < 0, the derivative (q2^ε)'(ρ*) = 2e2'ρ* + e1' actually decreases as ρ* increases (since e2' is negative). In traffic flow, this implies that the flux gradient (which relates to traffic speed) decreases with increasing density, reflecting congestion effects where higher density leads to lower speeds for the modified flux function q2^ε(ρ).

The correct condition should be βD_high - D_low > (1/2)Y - β(1/2)Y = (1/2)(1-β)Y. Economic Intuition: The condition highlights that a large deleveraging shock (high D_high relative to D_low) forces borrowers to cut spending significantly. To maintain equilibrium, the real interest rate must fall substantially to induce patient savers (high β, meaning low discount rate 1-β) to increase their consumption.

Explanation: The all-express system's round-trip time formula is derived by setting hj = 0 (no local run floors) and nj = n (only express run to floor n). The general formula τj = t0 + t1hj + (2/v)⋅nj simplifies to τn = t0 + (2/v)⋅n when hj = 0. The term t0′ = t0 + t1 in the all-express formula accounts for the constant time component plus the time for serving a single floor, but this is not directly derived from the general formula by simply setting hj = 1.
