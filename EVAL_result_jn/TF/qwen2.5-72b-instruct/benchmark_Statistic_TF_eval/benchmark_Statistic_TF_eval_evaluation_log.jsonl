Is this assumption valid only under homoscedasticity?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. Explanation: The naive bootstrap's equal probability assignment ($n^{-1}$) for selecting centered residuals relies on the homoscedasticity assumption.

In heteroscedastic models, error variances depend on $\\mathcal{X}$, so residuals are not exchangeable, and this equal-weighting scheme would fail to preserve the conditional variance structure.

When all V_i matrices are identical, V_i = V̄ for all i. In this case, the function T(V_i^{-1}) simplifies to T(V̄^{-1}) = 1/n, and T{(1^T V_i 1)^{-1} 11^T} also equals 1/n.

Explanation: The context explicitly states that when $Y$ is measured without error, the ratio $[Y|S_{0j}]/[S_{0j}|Y]$ equals 1.

This assumption simplifies the likelihood function, allowing for the integration over the random effects to obtain the marginal likelihood.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context describes a joint model that uses random effects to account for correlations within and between responses. It states that the joint likelihood integrates over the random effects, implying that the responses are conditionally independent given the random effects, and thus the joint density is the product of the individual conditional densities.\n\nQID: statistic-posneg-601-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"statistic-posneg-601-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly affirms the truth of the statement and accurately summarizes the conditional independence assumption in the joint model, matching the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "statistic-posneg-601-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly affirms the truth of the statement and accurately summarizes the conditional independence assumption in the joint model, matching the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "statistic-posneg-601-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly affirms the truth of the statement and accurately summarizes the conditional independence assumption in the joint model, matching the gold answer."}

The denominator includes $r$ and $2 \\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$, meaning that higher $r$ (more variable responses) will decrease the value of $f$, while higher $\\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}$ (more fixed responses) will increase the numerator and partially offset the denominator. Thus, tests with higher proportions of fixed responses are prioritized over those with higher proportions of variable responses, as the function aims to maximize the discriminatory power of the test.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The function \\( f(p, q, r) = \\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)} / [\\theta + (1 - \\theta) \\left\\{r + 2 \\operatorname*{min}{(p, q)}\\right\\}] \\) is designed to prioritize tests with higher proportions of fixed responses (either positive or negative) because the numerator is the minimum of the fixed positive and negative responses, while the denominator includes the proportion of variable responses, making the function value smaller for tests with higher variable responses.\n\nQID: statistic-posneg-664-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"statistic-posneg-664-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies that the function prioritizes fixed responses over variable responses, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about the numerator and denominator's roles.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "statistic-posneg-664-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies that the function prioritizes fixed responses over variable responses, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about the numerator and denominator's roles."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "statistic-posneg-664-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies that the function prioritizes fixed responses over variable responses, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about the numerator and denominator's roles."}

Explanation: While the context mentions that a total score exceeding 3 times the root of the variance may be considered significant, this is a simplified threshold.

Explanation: The ratio R(X|β) = D(X,𝒳₁|β)/D(X,𝒳₀|β) measures the relative distance of X to 𝒳₁ compared to 𝒳₀. A larger R(X|β) means X is farther from 𝒳₁ relative to 𝒳₀, implying X is closer to 𝒳₀ and thus more representative of Π₀. However, the question incorrectly states the implication. A larger R(X|β) actually implies X is less representative of Π₁ (not necessarily more representative of Π₀, unless the distances are explicitly compared).

The context explicitly states that the GPD distribution function is highly sensitive to the shape parameter $\\xi$, making direct fitting challenging if initial values are not close to the true parameter values.

The precision of estimates depends on the number of failures observed in each time interval. For intervals with fewer failures (e.g., the middle interval for $\\gamma_j$), estimates may be less precise.

Explanation: While the GPD has a threshold stability property (i.e., if exceedances over $u$ follow a GPD, then exceedances over any higher threshold $u' > u$ also follow a GPD with the same $\\xi$ but rescaled $\\psi$), this is an asymptotic result.

The context specifies that the saturated log-linear model includes parameters for main effects (A, C, M) and two-way interactions (AC, AM, CM), but the statement specifically mentions the model (A, CM) which includes only the main effects A and C, and the two-way interaction CM (θ₁¹^(A), θ₁^(C), θ₁^(M), and θ₁₁^(CM)), excluding all other two-way interactions.\n\nQID: statistic-posneg-753-1-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"statistic-posneg-753-1-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer is correct (TRUE) but the reasoning incorrectly describes the model as including main effects A and C only, whereas the gold answer clarifies it includes main effects for A, C, and M.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "statistic-posneg-753-1-2", "category": "CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH", "explanation": "The candidate's answer is correct (TRUE) but the reasoning incorrectly describes the model as including main effects A and C only, whereas the gold answer clarifies it includes main effects for A, C, and M."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "statistic-posneg-753-1-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer is correct (TRUE) but the reasoning incorrectly describes the model as including main effects A and C only, whereas the gold answer clarifies it includes main effects for A, C, and M."}
