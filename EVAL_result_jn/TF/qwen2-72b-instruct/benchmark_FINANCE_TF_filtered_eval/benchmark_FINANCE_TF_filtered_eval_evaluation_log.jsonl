Is it correct to interpret a high value of S as evidence against the null hypothesis of equal mean abnormal returns?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The test statistic S follows a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis of equal mean abnormal returns across the three groups. A high value of S indicates that the deviations of the group means from the overall mean (adjusted for their standard errors) are large, which would lead to rejection of the null hypothesis. The economic implication is that the market reacts differently to dividend changes across the three groups, suggesting that prior information or other group-specific factors influence the market's reaction.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. According to the context, the test statistic S is indeed used to test for equality of mean abnormal returns across three groups of firms.

Explanation: When C ≥ (1 - (α̲/ᾱ))(B - V), the cost of screening is high enough that the bank prefers not to screen any applicants (θ* = 0) and instead randomly rejects applications. Since the bank's policy is not observable, borrowers cannot distinguish between screened and unscreened applications, leading all borrowers (α* = ᾱ) to apply for a loan workout. The bank screens all applicants (k* = 1) because the high screening cost makes it suboptimal to screen only a portion. This aligns with the equilibrium condition where α* = max{α̲, (1 - θ*)k*ᾱ} = ᾱ when θ* = 0 and k* = 1.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. According to Proposition 2, Case 1 in the context, when the screening cost C is greater than or equal to (1 - (α̲/ᾱ))(B - V), the equilibrium policy adopted by the bank is indeed (θ* = 0, k* = 1), leading to α* = ᾱ, which matches the statement.\n\nQID: finance-posneg-3980-0-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"finance-posneg-3980-0-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the condition and the resulting bank policy, matching the gold answer's explanation and conclusion.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "finance-posneg-3980-0-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the condition and the resulting bank policy, matching the gold answer's explanation and conclusion."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "finance-posneg-3980-0-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the condition and the resulting bank policy, matching the gold answer's explanation and conclusion."}

The model includes a fiscal shock term ($F S_{c,t}$) and a lagged investment-capital ratio ($I C R_{f,t-1}$), which captures the dynamic effects of fiscal consolidation. The initial contraction is reflected in the negative coefficient on the fiscal shock term ($\beta^{h}$), while the medium-term expansion is driven by the positive coefficient on the lagged investment-capital ratio ($\\sigma^{h}$).

The derivative $\\frac{d(R T)}{d F} = \\frac{N}{(F+N)^{2}}$ shows that the sensitivity of $R T$ to changes in $F$ decreases as $F$ increases because the denominator $(F+N)^2$ grows larger.

The carry factor captures global systematic risk because country-specific shocks average out due to the law of large numbers, while the dollar factor captures US-specific risk.

The formula AIC = 2(s - ln L) includes both the number of parameters (s) and the log-likelihood (ln L). While increasing s can decrease the AIC if the likelihood remains constant, in practice, adding parameters typically affects the likelihood. The AIC penalizes model complexity (higher s) to avoid overfitting, so a model with more parameters will not necessarily have a lower AIC unless the improvement in the likelihood justifies the additional complexity.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nFALSE. According to the context, the AIC formula is AIC = 2(s - ln L), where s is the number of estimated parameters and L is the likelihood function. Assuming the likelihood L remains constant, an increase in s (more parameters) would lead to an increase in AIC because the term 2(s) increases linearly with s, while -2ln L remains constant.

Explanation: While the Lotto Investor's preference for skewness can lead to underdiversified portfolios (e.g., concentrating in assets with high skewness), this is not always the case. The model shows that when $\\phi \\rightarrow \\infty$, the Lotto Investor's demand function converges to the Traditional Investor's, resulting in a well-diversified portfolio.

The hedge rebalancing mechanism predicts symmetric effects because delta-hedging activities would equally influence stock prices moving toward or away from the strike price, regardless of direction. In contrast, the manipulation mechanism predicts asymmetry: call writers actively push prices down (increasing the probability of ending just below K) but do not push prices up (decreasing the probability of ending just above K), leading to a positive value for expression (10). Conversely, put writers push prices up (decreasing the probability of ending just below K) but do not push prices down (increasing the probability of ending just above K), leading to a negative value for expression (10).

The formula correctly captures only downward revisions in NAV because it takes the minimum of the difference between the current NAV and the expected NAV (previous NAV plus calls minus distributions) and zero. This ensures that only negative differences (markdowns) are recorded, while positive differences (markups) are ignored.

The welfare function shows that welfare depends on the equilibrium quantities of orders (x_I, x_R). Without a segmentation ban, the market can set separate spreads (s_I, s_R) for each order type, allowing prices to reflect the true cost of providing liquidity for each type. This aligns with the First Welfare Theorem, which states that competitive equilibria are Pareto efficient under certain conditions (no externalities, complete markets, etc.). A segmentation ban forces a single spread (s_b) for both order types, distorting price signals and leading to a suboptimal allocation of liquidity, hence reducing welfare (w_b < w).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE.

The formula $r_{t}^{*} = g_{t} + z_{t}$ explicitly defines the natural rate as the sum of the trend growth rate $g_{t}$ and a random walk component $z_{t}$. Since $z_{t}$ evolves as $z_{t} = z_{t-1} + \\epsilon_{z,t}$, it introduces persistence but does not incorporate real interest rate dynamics directly.

The coefficient β3 on the interaction term Post × Treat in the DiD model indeed captures the causal effect of political uncertainty on working capital, assuming the parallel trends assumption holds. A positive and significant β3 indicates that, relative to the control group, firms experiencing political turnover (treatment group) increase their working capital following the political change.

Is it correct to interpret that a higher fraction repurchased $(F_{P})$ would always lead to a more positive market reaction if the premium is positive?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFALSE. Explanation: While the formula does indeed represent a weighted average, the market reaction depends on both the premium and the CAR. A higher fraction repurchased $(F_{P})$ would give more weight to the premium term, but the CAR term could be negative or positive depending on market perception. For example, if the premium is positive but the CAR is negative (indicating a negative market reaction to the repurchase announcement), a higher $(F_{P})$ could still lead to a less positive or even negative overall reaction if the negative CAR dominates. Additionally, the market might interpret a high $(F_{P})$ as a signal of overpayment or financial distress, which could negatively impact the CAR.

Explanation: In cornered equilibria, Lemma 2 establishes that ∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ. For SE (f_b=1), ∂D_S/∂ϕ > 0 implies ∂D_L/∂ϕ > ∂D_S/∂ϕ > 0, meaning shortening maturity improves both bond values. For LE (f_b=0), ∂D_S/∂ϕ < 0 implies ∂D_S/∂ϕ < ∂D_L/∂ϕ < 0, meaning lengthening improves both bond values.

If two utility functions u1 and u2 are affine transformations of each other (i.e., u2(w) = a u1(w) + b with a > 0, b ∈ R), they represent the same preferences and yield the same certainty equivalent w* and thus the same bid price p.

According to the context, if an individual’s preferences over probability distributions can be represented by von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility with the associated Bernoulli utility function u(w), then an affine transformation au(w)+b, a>0, b∈R represents the same preferences.

The model specification does not inherently support the claim, as the high correlation between CEO and CFO equity incentives complicates the isolation of their individual effects. The paper explicitly cautions against drawing direct inferences from this joint specification due to multicollinearity. The economic intuition is that shared compensation structures (e.g., stock options granted to both roles during the same periods) create overlapping variation in the data, making it statistically challenging to attribute earnings management effects uniquely to CFO incentives when controlling for CEO incentives. Only if CFO incentives remain significant after addressing this collinearity (e.g., through instrumental variables or subsample analysis) would the claim hold.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nCANNOT_DETERMINE.

While it is true that higher risk-weighted assets (higher $w$) require more equity capital (higher $V_{B E}$), the capital requirement $h$ is not held constant. The formula $V_{B E}\\geq V_{B}\\times w\\times h$ shows that $V_{B E}$ must be proportional to both $w$ and $h$. The economic rationale is to ensure banks hold sufficient capital to absorb losses proportional to the riskiness of their assets ($w$) and the regulatory minimum ($h$).

In the quadratic equation for $\\eta$, the term $(r-\\kappa-\\delta^{2}/2)$ becomes smaller when $\\kappa>0$, leading to a larger positive root $\\eta_{1}$.

While the formula d^2x(p)/dp^2 = -2ρ(σ_q/σ_p) + (1-ρ^2)c_2σ_q^2 shows convexity generally increases with σ_q, this depends on correlation ρ. For highly positive ρ near +1, the first term dominates and convexity could decrease with σ_q.

Instead, it suggests that firms that saved more from reducing payouts experienced a smaller decline in investment compared to firms that did not save as much.

While β2 does represent the sensitivity of RWATA to changes in asset volatility, the interpretation as a first derivative is oversimplified due to endogeneity concerns. The paper explicitly notes that asset volatility (market-assessed risk) and RWATA (regulatory-assessed risk) may influence each other bidirectionally.

Therefore, the model as specified cannot directly test the hypothesis that higher-ability CEOs are more likely to receive equity grants.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context describes setting up a logistic regression model to test whether higher-ability CEOs in China are more likely to receive equity grants, based on the economic theory that equity grants are more effective for talented CEOs.

Is this statement true based on the formula for J_Pt and the economic intuition of the model?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The formula for J_Pt is given by J_Pt = e^b [1 + a2 (St/Xt) (1/(1+J_γt) - 1)] - 1. Since b < 0 (consumption jumps are negative), e^b < 1. Additionally, J_γt > 0 (risk aversion jumps up), so 1/(1+J_γt) < 1. Thus, the term in brackets is less than 1, and J_Pt = e^b * (term < 1) - 1 < 0. Economically, a negative consumption jump increases risk aversion (γt jumps up), which depresses the price-consumption ratio (Xt = a1 + a2/γt decreases). This amplifies the direct effect of the consumption drop, leading to a larger stock price decline.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT.

Explanation: The term δₜ[cₜ - Eₜ₋₁(sₜ)] shows that δₜ measures the weight of the central parity deviation in explaining exchange rate surprises. However, higher δₜ indicates greater credibility, meaning markets trust the central parity (e.g., a peg) more. Thus, sₜ becomes less sensitive to cₜ - Eₜ₋₁(sₜ) because δₜ acts as a stabilizing coefficient. High credibility (δₜ → 1) anchors expectations (Eₜ₋₁(sₜ) ≈ cₜ), reducing volatility.

The risk-neutral jump intensity adjustment follows from the exponential affine form of the SDF and the Girsanov theorem for jump processes.

The exclusion of underwriter reputation variables in the regression model likely introduces bias, especially post-Drexel's bankruptcy. Drexel was a dominant player in the junk bond market, and its collapse in 1990 significantly altered market perceptions and competition dynamics. The model, trained on 1977-1989 data, would not account for the sudden loss of Drexel's market power and the entry of commercial banks, which likely led to increased competition and lower fees.

In a pure random walk, the variance of q-differences should be exactly q times the variance of the first differences. Therefore, σ²(q) = q * σ²(1), which implies VR(q) = q * σ²(1) / σ²(1) = q.

Explanation: The condition $B(y) < D_i^{rf} = 1$ implies that the liquidation value $B(y)$ is less than the risk-free value of both short-term and long-term debt. Since debt holders have equal seniority and the total face value is normalized to 1, all debt holders receive $B(y)$ per unit of face value in bankruptcy. Because $B(y) < 1$, there is a positive loss-given-default for bondholders, and equity holders, who are residual claimants, recover nothing ($B(y)$ is entirely allocated to debt holders).

This is because Z₁₂(f,θ) ≥ 0 (the marginal repurchase cost is increasing in θ), and the inequality reflects that higher θ types (higher firm values) have a higher ratio of curvature (g) to marginal cost (b).

While the normalization of $a_{x}$ as the arithmetic mean of $\\log(m_{x,t})$ over time and the sums of $b_{x}$ and $k_{t}$ to unity and zero respectively helps in reducing the over-parameterization issue, it does not guarantee a unique solution. The model still requires a two-stage estimation procedure involving singular value decomposition (SVD) and re-estimation of $k_{t}$ to ensure a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nTRUE. The context explains that to stipulate a unique solution for the over-parameterized equation of the Lee-Carter model, the parameters are normalized. Specifically, $a_{x}$ is defined as the arithmetic mean of $\\\\(m_{x,t}\\\\)$ over time, and the sums of $b_{x}$ and $k_{t}$ are normalized to unity and zero respectively.

While the condition (1+η₁)(μ₁ + 2β₁ξ₁²)∑λₖpₖ₁ > μ₁∑λₖpₖ₁ ensures the existence of a unique negative solution q₀₂(t), it does not strictly require η₁ > 0.

The derivation involves differentiating the nth moment M(t) under the integral sign and substituting the Kolmogorov equation. The first term, nμM(t), comes from the drift component of the SDE, and the second term, (1/2)n(n-1)σ²E{[x(t)]^(n+2β-2)}, arises from the diffusion component after applying integration by parts twice.
