{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-19-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nFor Problem 2, analyze the decision changes from '14/50' to '18/46'. What does this imply about the efficiency of the NMOT in terms of decision-making?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe decision format '14/50' and '18/46' likely represents a ratio of two types of decisions (e.g., accept/reject, internal/third-party). For Problem 2:\n1. Previous Decision: 14/50 implies 14 decisions of one type and 50 of another.\n2. NMOT Decision: 18/46 shows an increase to 18 decisions of the first type and a decrease to 46 of the second.\n\nThis implies that the NMOT is more efficient in making decisions that favor the first type (e.g., internal deliveries), reducing reliance on the second type (e.g., third-party deliveries). The shift from 14 to 18 (a 28.57% increase) indicates improved decision-making efficiency.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the decision format\n- The 'Decision' column uses a 'X/Y' format representing two categories: packages where third-party delivery would save money (X) vs. those where internal delivery is better (Y).\n\nStep 2: Analyze Problem 2's change\n- Previous process: 14/50 (14 packages flagged for third-party savings, 50 for internal)\n- NMOT results: 18/46 (18 packages flagged for third-party savings, 46 for internal)\n\nStep 3: Interpret implications\n1. The NMOT identified 4 more packages (18 vs. 14) where third-party delivery would save costs\n2. This shows improved decision granularity (+28.6% increase in 'Save' identifications)\n3. The shift indicates NMOT makes more nuanced decisions by reallocating 4 instances from 'Not Save' to 'Save' category\n\nStep 4: Relate to efficiency\n- The increased 'Save' identifications demonstrate NMOT's enhanced ability to detect cost-saving opportunities\n- This aligns with the 3.84% cost reduction and massive time savings (>0.4 days = 9.6 hours vs. 12.5 seconds)\n- The decision shift implies NMOT improves both speed AND decision quality - identifying optimal shipping methods more efficiently than manual processes.\n\nQID: Management-table-19-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-19-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly interprets the decision format, analyzes the change, and relates it to improved efficiency and decision quality, aligning with the gold answer's implications.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-19-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly interprets the decision format, analyzes the change, and relates it to improved efficiency and decision quality, aligning with the gold answer's implications."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-19-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly interprets the decision format, analyzes the change, and relates it to improved efficiency and decision quality, aligning with the gold answer's implications."}

How does the difference in travel times impact the scheduling constraints, especially when considering the transition cell capacity constraint?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total travel time for a westbound freight train, sum the WB freight timings for all blocks: $18 + 17 + 6 + 25 + 16 + 26 = 108$ minutes. For a westbound passenger train, sum the WB passenger timings: $10 + 9 + 4 + 12 + 8 + 18 = 61$ minutes. The difference is $108 - 61 = 47$ minutes. This significant difference impacts scheduling because the passenger train can traverse the segment much faster, potentially causing conflicts at transition cells. The constraint $\\sum_{r\\in R}x_{i,j,u,v}^{r} \\leq 2$ must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding capacity when both train types are present in the same transition window.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate total travel time for WB freight train:\n- Freight WB timings (Table 4): Block1=18, Block2=17, Block3=6, Block4=25, Block5=16, Block6=26\n- Total = 18 + 17 + 6 + 25 + 16 + 26 = 108 minutes\n\nStep 2: Calculate total travel time for WB passenger train:\n- Passenger WB timings: Block1=10, Block2=9, Block3=4, Block4=12, Block5=8, Block6=18\n- Total = 10 + 9 + 4 + 12 + 8 + 18 = 61 minutes\n\nStep 3: Compute difference in travel times:\n108 minutes (freight) - 61 minutes (passenger) = 47-minute difference\n\nStep 4: Analyze scheduling constraints impact:\n1. Freight trains occupy blocks/transition cells longer (108 vs. 61 minutes), reducing available capacity\n2. Faster passenger trains may catch up to slower freight trains at crossover points\n3. Transition cell capacity (νₜⁱ=2) limits simultaneous transitions. A 47-minute gap implies passenger trains could overlap with multiple freight trains in adjacent blocks\n4. Waiting arcs (stopped trains) further stress transition cell capacity since both trains and waiting arcs count toward the 2-train limit\n5. Disparity forces schedulers to either:\n   - Increase spacing between trains to prevent congestion\n   - Prioritize passenger trains via overtakes (limited by crossover frequency)\n   - Accept reduced network efficiency due to speed mismatch\n\nQID: Management-table-613-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-613-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates the travel times for both train types, identifies the 47-minute difference, and thoroughly explains the scheduling constraints impact, aligning with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-613-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the travel times for both train types, identifies the 47-minute difference, and thoroughly explains the scheduling constraints impact, aligning with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-613-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the travel times for both train types, identifies the 47-minute difference, and thoroughly explains the scheduling constraints impact, aligning with the gold answer."}

The T² statistic is given by $T^2 = n(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)^T S^{-1} (\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)$. Under the null hypothesis of in-control process, $T^2$ follows a scaled F-distribution: $\\frac{n - p}{p(n - 1)} T^2 \\sim F_{p, n - p}$. The expected value of $T^2$ is derived as follows:\n1. The expected value of an F-distributed random variable $F_{p, n - p}$ is $\\frac{n - p}{n - p - 2}$ for $n - p > 2$.\n2. Therefore, $E\\left[\\frac{n - p}{p(n - 1)} T^2\\right] = \\frac{n - p}{n - p - 2}$.\n3.

Compare this to the Normal scenario's average profit per flight. What does this suggest about the efficiency of flight delays as a strategy?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: For Model Ba, non-canceled flights = 39 - 8 = 31. Objective value = -28,030,763 NTS. Average profit per flight = $\\frac{-28,030,763}{31} \\approx -904,218$ NTS. Step 2: Normal scenario average = $\\frac{-35,764,949}{39} \\approx -917,050$ NTS. Step 3: The proximity of these averages (-904,218 vs. -917,050) suggests that delaying flights (Model Ba) nearly preserves per-flight profitability compared to normal operations, making it an efficient strategy when cancellations are minimized.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify Model Ba's data\n- Objective Value (profit) = -NT\\$28,030,763\n- Canceled flights = 8\n- Total original flights = 39\nNon-canceled flights = 39 - 8 = 31\n\nStep 2: Calculate Ba's average profit per non-canceled flight\n= (-28,030,763) ÷ 31 ≈ -NT\\$904,218 per flight\n\nStep 3: Identify Normal scenario's data\n- Objective Value = -NT\\$35,764,949\n- Total flights = 39\nAverage profit = (-35,764,949) ÷ 39 ≈ -NT\\$917,050 per flight\n\nStep 4: Compare results\n- Ba (with cancellations/delays): -NT\\$904,218\n- Normal (no adjustments): -NT\\$917,050\n\nConclusion: The smaller loss per flight in Model Ba suggests flight delays combined with selective cancellations marginally improve operational efficiency compared to maintaining all flights.

Each row of $H$ corresponds to an element of $M$ (excluding $l$), and each column corresponds to a circuit of $M$ that contains $l$. The entry $H_{e,c}$ is 1 if element $e$ is in circuit $c$, and 0 otherwise. The constraints $H \\cdot v \\leqslant h$ in $P(M,l,h)$ ensure that the sum of the flows $v_c$ through the circuits $c$ does not exceed the capacities $h_e$ for each element $e$. The matrix $H$ thus encodes the structure of the matroid and the flow constraints imposed by the capacities $h$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the role of element l in matroid M. Matrix H is constructed using circuits of M that contain element l. Each circuit C ∋ l becomes a row in H.\n\nStep 2: For each such circuit, create a characteristic vector where entries = 1 indicate membership in the circuit. This forms the rows of H.\n\nStep 3: The constraints H·v ≤ h then enforce that for every circuit containing l, the sum of selected elements (v_i) in that circuit cannot exceed h's corresponding entry – typically h = [1,...,1]^T to maintain independence.\n\nStep 4: This construction ensures solutions v respect matroid independence constraints specifically involving element l, as selecting multiple elements from any l-containing circuit would violate H·v ≤ 1 constraints.\n\nQID: Management-table-682-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-682-2\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the role of element l and the construction of matrix H from circuits containing l, but misrepresents the structure of H (rows should correspond to elements, not circuits).

The difference is $0.365 - 0.303 = 0.062$. This difference suggests that the Koyck model, which assumes a geometric decay of effects, may understate the long-run impact compared to the direct estimation, which does not impose such a structure.

Provide a mathematical relationship between grid cell size and velocity estimation error.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nIn SCEN2, error-free $\\mathrm{Vc}_{t}^{\\mathrm{p}}$ implies perfect spatial resolution. However, in practice, the error $\\epsilon$ in velocity estimation due to grid cell size $\\Delta x$ can be modeled as $\\epsilon \\propto \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathrm{Vc}_{t}^{\\mathrm{p}}}{\\partial x^2}\\right) (\\Delta x)^2$, where the second derivative represents the curvature of the velocity field. Smaller $\\Delta x$ reduces $\\epsilon$ quadratically.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that SCEN2 uses error-free SSH and bias-free perpendicular velocity components gridded into cell averages. The velocity component $\\mathrm{Vc}_t^\\mathrm{p}$ is derived from the SSH gradient via $(g/f)\\frac{\\partial(\\mathrm{SSH}_t - \\langle\\mathrm{SSH}\\rangle)}{\\partial x}$.\n\nStep 2: The spatial derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ is approximated numerically over grid cells of size $\\Delta x$. For finite differencing, the truncation error in estimating the gradient scales with $\\Delta x^n$, where $n$ depends on the discretization method (e.g., first-order schemes have $n=1$).\n\nStep 3: Under error-free SSH assumptions, the dominant velocity error arises from spatial discretization. If unresolved sub-grid SSH variations exist, the gradient approximation error increases with coarser resolution. A common relationship for gradient estimation error is $\\text{Error} \\propto \\Delta x$ (first-order methods) or $\\text{Error} \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$ (second-order methods).\n\nStep 4: Since $\\mathrm{Vc}_t^\\mathrm{p}$ is directly proportional to the SSH gradient, the velocity estimation error $\\epsilon_v$ inherits this scaling. For typical satellite altimetry processing, the relationship simplifies to:\n\n$$\\epsilon_v \\propto \\Delta x$$\n\nConclusion: The velocity estimation error increases linearly with grid cell size under SCEN2 assumptions.\n\nQID: Management-table-511-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-511-1\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the dependency of velocity estimation error on grid cell size but incorrectly states a linear relationship.

The Riemannian gradient descent update rule is $x_{k+1} = R_{x_k}(-\\alpha_k \\text{grad} f(x_k))$.\n\nStep 3: Using the retraction-smoothness condition, we can derive the decrease in function value per iteration: $f(x_{k+1}) - f(x_k) \\leq -\\alpha_k \\|\\text{grad} f(x_k)\\|^2 + \\frac{L_g \\alpha_k^2}{2} \\|\\text{grad} f(x_k)\\|^2$.\n\nStep 4: Optimizing the step size $\\alpha_k = \\frac{1}{L_g}$ gives $f(x_{k+1}) - f(x_k) \\leq -\\frac{1}{2L_g} \\|\\text{grad} f(x_k)\\|^2$.\n\nStep 5: Summing over $k$ iterations and using the fact that $f$ is bounded below, we get $\\min_{0 \\leq k \\leq T} \\|\\text{grad} f(x_k)\\|^2 \\leq \\frac{2L_g (f(x_0) - f^*)}{T}$. Setting this to $\\epsilon^2$ gives $T = O(\\frac{L_g}{\\epsilon^2})$.\n\nStep 6: The dimension $d$ affects the oracle complexity because each gradient estimate requires $O(d)$ function evaluations. Thus, the total oracle complexity is $O(dT) = O(d/\\epsilon^2)$, matching the table entry.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key quantities. The ZO-RGD algorithm has iteration complexity \\(O(d/\\epsilon^2)\\) and oracle complexity \\(O(d/\\epsilon^2)\\), where \\(d\\) is the intrinsic manifold dimension. The retraction-smoothness condition bounds approximation errors during updates.\n\nStep 2: Relate iteration complexity to convergence rate. For a convergence criterion \\( \\epsilon \\), the required number of iterations grows linearly with \\(d\\) and quadratically with \\(1/\\epsilon\\). This implies the convergence rate dependency on \\(d\\) is \\(O(\\sqrt{d/T})\\) after \\(T\\) iterations.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the retraction-smoothness role. The condition \\( |f(R_x(\\eta)) - f(x) - \\langle \\mathrm{grad}f(x), \\eta \\rangle_x | \\leq \\frac{L_g}{2}\\|\\eta\\|^2 \\) ensures a controlled approximation error during retraction updates. This allows the algorithm to inherit Euclidean-like convergence properties scaled by \\(d\\).\n\nStep 4: Combine results. The linear dependence on \\(d\\) in both complexities indicates that higher intrinsic dimension \\(d\\) directly slows convergence proportionally. Thus, the convergence rate (as a function of \\(d\\)) degrades linearly with increasing \\(d\\), under the retraction-smoothness guarantee.\n\nQID: Management-table-632-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-632-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the linear relationship between dimension \\(d\\) and complexity, but lacks the detailed derivation and optimization steps shown in the gold answer.

This requires that for each deleted vertex $v(t_{i})$, the link of $v(t_{i})$ in $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$ is a pure $(\\pmb{s}-1)$-dimensional complex. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $\\text{dim}(\\text{link}(v(t_{i}), \\mathscr{C}_{m-1})) = \\pmb{s}-1$ for all $i = t_{m-1}+1, \\ldots, t_{m}$. If this condition holds, then $\\mathscr{C}_{m} = \\mathscr{C}_{m-1} \\setminus v(t_{m-1}+1) \\setminus \\cdots \\setminus v(t_{m})$ will also be pure $\\pmb{s}$-dimensional.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall that a pure $\\pmb{s}$-dimensional complex requires all maximal faces (facets) to be $s$-dimensional. For $\\mathscr{C}_m$ to remain pure after vertex deletions from $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$, the deletions must not create new maximal faces of lower dimension.\n\nStep 2: In vertex decomposability, a shedding vertex deletion preserves purity because its link is vertex-decomposable of dimension $s-1$, and its removal leaves facets either unchanged or replaced by properly contained $s$-dimensional faces.\n\nStep 3: The given hierarchy $\\mathfrak{D}(s,k)$ implies that $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$ must belong to a decomposability class ensuring the vertices $v(t_{m-1}+1),\\ldots,v(t_m)$ are shedding vertices for $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$.\n\nStep 4: The critical condition is that all deleted vertices in the block $v(t_{m-1}+1),\\ldots,v(t_m)$ must be shedding vertices of $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$ when removed in sequence. This ensures their deletion does not leave $(s-1)$-dimensional faces as new maximal simplices.\n\nConclusion: $\\mathscr{C}_m$ remains pure $\\pmb{s}$-dimensional iff every vertex $v(t_{m-1}+1),\\ldots,v(t_m)$ is a shedding vertex of the current complex $\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$ at the time of deletion.\n\nQID: Management-table-421-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-421-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the conditions for $\\mathscr{C}_{m}$ to remain pure $\\pmb{s}$-dimensional, focusing on the concept of shedding vertices and their role in preserving the purity of the complex.

The f-circuits are:\n   - $(3, 11, 8, 4, 1)$\n   - $(5, 4)$\n   - $(6, 2, 4, 7)$\n   - $(9, 7, 8, 12)$\n   - $(10, 11)$\n\n2. **Construct the matrix $C$**: The matrix $C$ has dimensions $5 \\times 12$ (5 circuits, 12 edges). Each entry $c_{kl}$ is $+1$ if edge $l$ is in circuit $k$ and the orientations coincide, $-1$ if the orientations do not coincide, and $0$ otherwise. Since all edges coincide with the circuit orientation, all non-zero entries are $+1$.\n\n   The matrix $C$ is:\n   $$\n   C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   $$\n   (Rows correspond to circuits in the order listed above, and columns correspond to edges 1 through 12.)\n\n3. **Apply the circuit law**: The circuit law states that for each circuit $k$, the sum of the offset variables $x_l$ for the edges in the circuit must equal an integer $n_k$. Thus, the constraints are:\n   $$\n   \\begin{cases}\n   x_1 + x_3 + x_4 + x_8 + x_{11} = n_1 \\\\\n   x_4 + x_5 = n_2 \\\\\n   x_2 + x_4 + x_6 + x_7 = n_3 \\\\\n   x_7 + x_8 + x_9 + x_{12} = n_4 \\\\\n   x_{10} + x_{11} = n_5\n   \\end{cases}\n   $$\n   where $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5$ are integers.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the circuit matrix structure. The graph has 12 edges (e=12) and 5 f-circuits (chords 3,5,6,9,10), requiring a 5×12 matrix.\n\nStep 2: Determine entries for each f-circuit row. Each row corresponds to an f-circuit from Table I. Since all edges in f-circuits coincide with circuit orientation (Definition 5), every listed edge gets +1.\n\nStep 3: Construct matrix rows:\n- Row 1 (Chord 3): Edges (1,3,4,8,11) → +1s in cols 1,3,4,8,11\n- Row 2 (Chord 5): Edges (4,5) → +1s in cols 4,5\n- Row 3 (Chord 6): Edges (2,4,6,7) → +1s in cols 2,4,6,7\n- Row 4 (Chord 9): Edges (7,8,9,12) → +1s in cols 7,8,9,12\n- Row 5 (Chord 10): Edges (10,11) → +1s in cols 10,11\n\nStep 4: Write circuit matrix C:\n$$C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nStep 5: Apply circuit law constraints. For each row k:\n$$\\sum_{l=1}^{12} c_{kl}x_l = n_k$$\nThis gives 5 equations:\n1. $x_1 + x_3 + x_4 + x_8 + x_{11} = n_1$\n2. $x_4 + x_5 = n_2$\n3. $x_2 + x_4 + x_6 + x_7 = n_3$\n4. $x_7 + x_8 + x_9 + x_{12} = n_4$\n5. $x_{10} + x_{11} = n_5$\n\nMatrix form: $C\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{n}$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the offset variables vector and $\\mathbf{n}$ is integer constraints vector.\n\nQID: Management-table-461-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-461-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately constructs the circuit matrix $C$ and correctly applies the circuit law to express the constraints on the offset variables $x_l$, matching the gold answer in both structure and reasoning.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-461-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately constructs the circuit matrix $C$ and correctly applies the circuit law to express the constraints on the offset variables $x_l$, matching the gold answer in both structure and reasoning."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-461-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately constructs the circuit matrix $C$ and correctly applies the circuit law to express the constraints on the offset variables $x_l$, matching the gold answer in both structure and reasoning."}

This ensures that the marginal contribution of any player $i$ to any coalition $S$ is non-increasing, i.e., $W(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - W(S) \\geq W(T \\cup \\{i\\}) - W(T)$ for all $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq N \\setminus \\{i\\}$. Under this condition, the game is a potential game, and thus admits a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that pure Nash equilibria (PNE) exist in potential games through finite improvement property.\nStep 2: Identify that the equal share rule assigns utility U_i(a) = ∑_{r∈a_i} W_r({a}^r)/|{a}^r| where {a}^r is the set of users of resource r.\nStep 3: Construct a potential function Φ(a) = ∑_{r∈R} W_r({a}^r).

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-683-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nHow does the MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ characterize optimal policies in the context of $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable projects?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ characterizes optimal policies by indicating the threshold at which it is optimal to switch between active and passive actions in a state $i$. For an $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable project, the $S_{i}$-active policy is optimal for the $\\nu$-wage problem if and only if $\\nu\\in[\\nu_{i}^{*},\\nu_{i+1}^{*}]$. This is derived from the relation $\\nu_{i}^{*}=-\\frac{\\Delta f^{S_{i}}}{\\Delta g^{S_{i}}}$, where $\\Delta f^{S_{i}}=f^{S_{i}}-f^{S_{i-1}}$ and $\\Delta g^{S_{i}}=g^{S_{i}}-g^{S_{i-1}}$. The nondecreasing property of $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ ensures that higher states have higher indices, aligning with the economics law of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that MPI ν_i^* (Marginal Productivity Index) is defined as -Δf^{S_i}/Δg^{S_i}, measuring the marginal trade-off between cost reduction (Δf^{S_i}) and work expenditure (Δg^{S_i}) when activating a project at state i.\n\nStep 2: In F-indexable projects (partial conservation law-compliant systems), the existence of a work-cost efficient frontier allows MPI ranking to emerge. This ensures states can be monotonically ordered by ν_i^*.\n\nStep 3: The MPI characterizes optimal policies by providing a priority rule: at optimality, projects in states with higher ν_i^* values should receive priority for activation/resource allocation. This extends Gittins-index logic to restless bandits.\n\nStep 4: For countable-state M/G/1 queues in the paper's context, this translates to threshold policies where activation occurs when MPI exceeds a Lagrangian multiplier tied to resource constraints – aligning with Whittle index concepts.\n\nStep 5: F-indexability ensures the MPI ranking remains consistent across states through diminishing returns properties, guaranteeing implementable index-based policies without complex dynamic programming.\n\nQID: Management-table-683-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-683-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly explains how the MPI ν_i^* characterizes optimal policies in F-indexable projects, detailing the marginal trade-off, priority rule, and connection to Whittle index concepts, aligning with the gold answer's explanation.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-683-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly explains how the MPI ν_i^* characterizes optimal policies in F-indexable projects, detailing the marginal trade-off, priority rule, and connection to Whittle index concepts, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-683-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly explains how the MPI ν_i^* characterizes optimal policies in F-indexable projects, detailing the marginal trade-off, priority rule, and connection to Whittle index concepts, aligning with the gold answer's explanation."}

Interpret the result in the context of economies of scale.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant data.\n- Standard demand: $P_b = 23.5\\%$, cost = $0.075/pass. mi$\n- Specially calibrated demand: $P_b = 55.9\\%$, cost = $0.042/pass. mi$\n\nStep 2: Calculate percentage changes.\n- Change in $P_b$: $$\\frac{55.9 - 23.5}{23.5} \\times 100 = 137.87\\%$$\n- Change in cost: $$\\frac{0.042 - 0.075}{0.075} \\times 100 = -44.00\\%$$\n\nStep 3: Compute elasticity.\nElasticity ($E$) is the ratio of percentage change in quantity to percentage change in price:\n$$E = \\frac{137.87\\%}{-44.00\\%} = -3.13$$\n\nInterpretation: The elasticity of -3.13 indicates that public transportation usage is highly elastic with respect to cost. A 1% decrease in cost leads to a 3.13% increase in usage. This supports the presence of significant economies of scale, as lower costs (likely due to higher patronage) lead to disproportionately higher usage.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify required data from Table I\n- Public transportation usage (modal split):\n  • Standard Demand Relation = 23.5%\n  • Specially Calibrated Demand = 55.9%\n- Public mode cost per passenger mile:\n  • Standard Demand Relation = $0.075/pass. mi\n  • Specially Calibrated Demand = $0.042/pass. mi\n\nStep 2: Calculate percentage changes\nΔQ = 55.9% − 23.5% = 32.4%\nΔP = $0.042 − $0.075 = −$0.033\n\nStep 3: Compute midpoint elasticity\nMidpoint Q = (23.5% + 55.9%)/2 = 39.7%\nMidpoint P = ($0.075 + $0.042)/2 = $0.0585\n\n%ΔQ = (32.4/39.7) ≈ 81.61%\n%ΔP = (−0.033/0.0585) ≈ −56.41%\n\nElasticity (E) = (%ΔQ/%ΔP) ≈ 81.61%/−56.41% ≈ −1.45\n\nStep 4: Interpret elasticity\n|E| ≈ 1.45 > 1 ⇒ Elastic demand. A 56.41% cost reduction increased usage by 81.61%, indicating public transportation demand is highly responsive to fare changes.\n\nStep 5: Contextualize with economies of scale\nThe elasticity shows that lowering public transit costs (e.g., through operational efficiencies) leads to disproportionately higher ridership. Increased usage spreads fixed infrastructure/training costs over more passenger-miles, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of cost reduction and demand growth – a hallmark of economies of scale.\n\nQID: Management-table-508-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-508-1\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the data and calculates elasticity using the midpoint method, but the interpretation of elasticity magnitude differs from the gold answer (-1.45 vs -3.13).

The odds ratio is calculated as $e^{0.465} \\approx 1.592$. This means that having siblings increases the odds of a positive outcome by approximately 59.2%.

This implies that the residuals $U(t)$ in the modified Koyck model are not autocorrelated, supporting the consistency of OLS estimates.

Given z_j^{(k;n)} = \\binom{n}{k}^{-1} \\binom{n-j}{k-j}, we need to determine when this product equals zero.\nStep 2: Recognize that binomial coefficients \\binom{a}{b} are zero if b < 0 or b > a. For the term \\binom{n-j}{k-j} in the formula, this implies it is zero if k-j < 0 or k-j > n-j.\nStep 3: Observe that k-j < 0 corresponds to j > k (component-wise in the multi-index). Since k ≤ n (to ensure \\binom{n}{k} in the denominator is non-zero), the condition k-j > n-j is equivalent to k > n, which does not occur here.\nStep 4: Conclude that z_j^{(k;n)} = 0 if and only if at least one component of the multi-index j exceeds the corresponding component of k (i.e., j ≰ k). This makes one of the binomial coefficients in the product zero, nullifying the entire expression.\n\nQID: Management-table-548-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-548-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the condition under which $z_{j}^{(k;n)} = 0$ as when at least one component of $j$ exceeds the corresponding component of $k$ (i.e., $j_i > k_i$ for some $i$).

Suppose the utility function is $U_y = \\ln(T) + \\gamma S$, where $\\gamma$ represents the weight of ascription. How does a change in doctrinal strictness (i.e., a shift in $T$) affect the optimal $S$?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The utility function is $U_y = \\ln(T) + \\gamma S$. Step 2: The individual maximizes $U_y$ subject to doctrinal constraints. Step 3: The first-order condition for $S$ is $\\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial S} = \\gamma = 0$ if $S$ is unconstrained. Step 4: However, if $S$ is constrained by $T$ (e.g., $S \\leq kT$ for some constant $k$), then stricter tenets (higher $T$) relax the constraint, allowing higher $S$. Step 5: Thus, doctrinal strictness can indirectly increase ascription by expanding its feasible range.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the utility function and variables\nThe utility function for symbol-directed personalities is given as \\( U_y = \\ln(T) + \\gamma S \\), where \\( T \\) represents doctrinal strictness (tenet) and \\( S \\) represents ascription. The parameter \\( \\gamma \\) denotes the weight of ascription.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the separability of variables\nSince \\( \\ln(T) \\) and \\( \\gamma S \\) are additive and separable in the utility function, changes in \\( T \\) do not directly influence the marginal utility of \\( S \\). The marginal utility of \\( S \\) is constant and equal to \\( \\gamma \\), independent of \\( T \\).\n\nStep 3: Consider optimization constraints\nWithout explicit constraints linking \\( T \\) and \\( S \\), the optimal \\( S \\) is determined solely by its marginal utility (\\( \\gamma \\)). If \\( \\gamma > 0 \\), utility increases indefinitely with \\( S \\), implying \\( S \\) would theoretically rise to infinity. However, practical constraints (not specified in the problem) would cap \\( S \\).\n\nStep 4: Assess comparative statics\nA change in doctrinal strictness (\\( T \\)) affects the \\( \\ln(T) \\) term but does not alter the marginal value of \\( S \\). Since there is no cross-term or interaction between \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) in the utility function, the optimal \\( S \\) remains unaffected by shifts in \\( T \\).\n\nConclusion: A change in doctrinal strictness (\\( T \\)) has no effect on the optimal level of ascription (\\( S \\)) because the utility function’s structure decouples their marginal impacts.\n\nQID: Management-table-808-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-808-2\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the separability of variables and the marginal utility of S, but misses the indirect effect of doctrinal constraints (e.g., S ≤ kT) discussed in the gold answer.

For large-scale problems where $n \\gg T$, this ratio becomes significantly large, indicating that the sparse hierarchy is computationally more efficient.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-124-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven the table data, analyze how the fill rate ($\\alpha$) changes with varying production cycle lengths ($N$) and lead times ($L$) when the planning time ($M$) is zero. Specifically, compare the scenarios for $N=5$ and $N=20$ with $L=0$ and $L=10$. What mathematical relationship can be inferred from these observations?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract the relevant data points from the table for $N=5$ and $N=20$ with $M=0$ and $L=0$ and $L=10$.\nFor $N=5$, $L=0$: $\\alpha=97.97$, $\\%\\triangle=-0.03$\nFor $N=5$, $L=10$: $\\alpha=97.99$, $\\%\\triangle=-0.01$\nFor $N=20$, $L=0$: $\\alpha=97.99$, $\\%\\triangle=-0.02$\nFor $N=20$, $L=10$: $\\alpha=97.99$, $\\%\\triangle=-0.01$\n\nStep 2: Observe the changes in $\\alpha$ and $\\%\\triangle$.\n- For $N=5$, increasing $L$ from 0 to 10 results in a slight increase in $\\alpha$ (from 97.97 to 97.99) and a reduction in the negative percentage change (from -0.03 to -0.01).\n- For $N=20$, increasing $L$ from 0 to 10 results in no change in $\\alpha$ (remains 97.99) but a reduction in the negative percentage change (from -0.02 to -0.01).\n\nStep 3: Infer the mathematical relationship.\nThe data suggests that for shorter production cycles ($N=5$), the fill rate is more sensitive to changes in lead time ($L$) compared to longer production cycles ($N=20$). This can be modeled as:\n$\\alpha(N, L) = \\alpha_0 - k(N) \\cdot L$\nwhere $k(N)$ is a decreasing function of $N$, indicating that the impact of $L$ on $\\alpha$ diminishes as $N$ increases.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant data columns for M=0 scenarios. Focus on L=0 M=0 and L=10 M=0 columns since M=0 is fixed.\n\nStep 2: Compare N=5 vs N=20 at L=0 M=0:\n- At N=5 (α=98): Actual fill rate = 97.97 (-0.03% deviation)\n- At N=20 (α=98): Actual fill rate = 97.99 (-0.02% deviation)\nLonger N reduces deviation from target α, showing fill rate stability improves with larger N.\n\nStep 3: Compare L=0 vs L=10 impacts:\nFor N=5 (α=98):\n- L=0: 97.97 (-0.03%)\n- L=10: 97.99 (-0.01%)\nFor N=20 (α=98):\n- L=0: 97.99 (-0.02%)\n- L=10: 97.99 (-0.01%)\nLengthening L reduces deviation, but this effect weakens as N increases.\n\nStep 4: Observe pattern across all α targets (98/95/92):\n- Deviation magnitude |%△| consistently decreases as N or L increases.\n- At N=20 + L=10, deviations are smallest (≤0.04%).\n\nStep 5: Mathematical relationship:\nFill rate deviation from target (Δα) follows Δα ∝ 1/(N + L). Longer N or L reduces deviation, indicating fill rate stability improves with the total horizon length (N+L).

Calculate the steady-state average waiting time ($W_q$) using the M/M/1 queue formula. How does varying the number of replications affect the confidence interval of $W_q$?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: For an M/M/1 queue, $W_q = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu(\\mu - \\lambda)}$. Substituting $\\lambda = 5$ and $\\mu = 6$, we get $W_q = \\frac{5}{6(6 - 5)} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$ hours.

Doubling $n$ reduces the width by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the M/M/1 queue formula for steady-state average waiting time ($W_q$).

Increasing the number of replications reduces the standard error of the simulation output (since standard error $= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$), leading to narrower confidence intervals.

For each leaf $l$ being pruned, $LDV(r)$ of its remote vertex $r$ is updated to $LV(l)$ if $LV(l) > LDV(r)$ (Step 2(ii)).\n2. If $r$ becomes a leaf after pruning, $LV(r)$ is updated based on the condition in Step 2(iv): \n   - If $LDV(r) + A(r) > A0(r)$, then $LV(r) = LDV(r) + A(r) + B(rr')$, where $r'$ is the new remote vertex of $r$.\n   - Otherwise, $LV(r) = A0(r) + B(rr')$.\n\nThis condition ensures that $LV(r)$ captures the maximum path function value for paths ending at $r$, considering both the path through its previous leaves and the path starting at $r$ itself.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Initialize LV values for initial leaves\n- In Step 1 of TCA, nodes with degree 1 (leaves) have their LV initialized as LV(I) = A0(I) + B(I).

This means NR-ACSLS is approximately 1.83 times faster than ACS-Greedy.

For RSCT to be constant, the ratio $\\frac{[\\partial F/\\partial z_\\alpha]}{[\\partial F/\\partial z_i]}$ must be constant. This implies that $F$ must be linearly homogeneous in $z_\\alpha$ and $z_i$, i.e., $F(\\lambda z_\\alpha, \\lambda z_i) = \\lambda F(z_\\alpha, z_i)$. Under this condition, the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z_\\alpha}$ and $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z_i}$ will scale proportionally, keeping RSCT constant.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall the RSCT definition from the given formula:\nRSCT_{z_i z_α} = -dz_i/dz_α = (∂F/∂z_α)/(∂F/∂z_i)\n\nStep 2: For RSCT to be constant, the ratio (∂F/∂z_α)/(∂F/∂z_i) must remain constant for all z_α and z_i. This implies:\n∂/∂z_j[(∂F/∂z_α)/(∂F/∂z_i)] = 0 ∀ j ∈ {i,α}\n\nStep 3: Apply quotient rule differentiation:\n[(∂²F/∂z_j∂z_α)(∂F/∂z_i) - (∂F/∂z_α)(∂²F/∂z_j∂z_i)]/(∂F/∂z_i)² = 0\n\nStep 4: Since denominators are squared terms and non-zero, the numerator must vanish:\n(∂²F/∂z_j∂z_α)(∂F/∂z_i) = (∂F/∂z_α)(∂²F/∂z_j∂z_i)\n\nStep 5: For this equality to hold for all j ∈ {i,α}, F must satisfy cross-partial equality:\n∂²F/(∂z_j∂z_α) = k(∂²F/∂z_j∂z_i)\nwhere k is a constant ratio of first derivatives.\n\nStep 6: This condition is only universally satisfied when F has linear characteristics in z_i and z_α. The general solution requires F to be a linear function or a function of a linear combination:\nF(z_i,z_α) = f(a z_i + b z_α + c)\nwhere a,b,c are constants. This makes all second partial derivatives zero, ensuring constant RSCT.\n\nConclusion: The RSCT remains constant if and only if the system characteristic function F is linear in z_i and z_α or depends exclusively on their linear combination.\n\nQID: Management-table-825-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-825-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly derives the condition for constant RSCT by analyzing the partial derivatives and concluding that F must be linear in z_i and z_α or depend on their linear combination, which matches the gold answer's requirement of linear homogeneity.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-825-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly derives the condition for constant RSCT by analyzing the partial derivatives and concluding that F must be linear in z_i and z_α or depend on their linear combination, which matches the gold answer's requirement of linear homogeneity."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-825-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly derives the condition for constant RSCT by analyzing the partial derivatives and concluding that F must be linear in z_i and z_α or depend on their linear combination, which matches the gold answer's requirement of linear homogeneity."}

Use the table to identify freeway and non-freeway segments.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total fuel consumption for Route 1A and Route 1B, we first identify the freeway and non-freeway segments from the table. For Route 1A, the freeway segments are W I-94 (7.80 km), E I-94 (2.43 km), totaling $7.80 + 2.43 = 10.23\\text{ km}$. The non-freeway segments are $29.54 - 10.23 = 19.31\\text{ km}$. Thus, fuel consumption for Route 1A is $(10.23 \\times 0.08) + (19.31 \\times 0.12) = 0.8184 + 2.3172 = 3.1356\\text{ L}$. For Route 1B, the freeway segments are W I-94 (2.70 km), S I-94 (8.67 km), totaling $2.70 + 8.67 = 11.37\\text{ km}$. The non-freeway segments are $30.20 - 11.37 = 18.83\\text{ km}$. Thus, fuel consumption for Route 1B is $(11.37 \\times 0.08) + (18.83 \\times 0.12) = 0.9096 + 2.2596 = 3.1692\\text{ L}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify freeway segments for Route 1A. From the table:\n- W I-94 (freeway): 7.80 km\n- E I-94 (freeway): 2.43 km\nTotal freeway distance for Route 1A = 7.80 + 2.43 = 10.23 km\nNon-freeway distance = 29.54 km (total) - 10.23 km = 19.31 km\nFuel consumption for Route 1A = (10.23 km × 0.08 L/km) + (19.31 km × 0.12 L/km) = 0.8184 L + 2.3172 L = 3.1356 L ≈ 3.14 L\n\nStep 2: Identify freeway segments for Route 1B.

How do these differences impact the applicability of each method to Problem (1)?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\n1. **Assumptions on $f$:** DCAe does not require $f$ to be L-smooth or convex, whereas pDCAe requires both L-smoothness and convexity of $f$. This makes DCAe applicable to a broader class of functions.\n2. **Assumptions on $r$:** Both methods assume $r$ is a DC function, but pDCAe requires additional convexity of $f$.\n3. **Impact on Problem (1):** Since Problem (1) involves minimizing the sum of an $(L,l)$-relative smooth function and a DC function, DCAe's relaxed assumptions on $f$ make it more suitable for problems where $f$ is nonconvex and not L-smooth. The convergence rate of DCAe is derived under the KL assumption, which is not restricted by the convexity or smoothness of $f$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify assumptions for DCAe and pDCAe from the table:\n- pDCAe requires L-smoothness (Yes) and convexity (Yes) for f, with r being a DC function.\n- DCAe (implied by 'Our methods') requires no L-smoothness (No) and no convexity (No) for f, while r remains a DC function.\n\nStep 2: Analyze differences:\nKey distinction lies in f's requirements: pDCAe demands stronger smoothness (L-smooth) and convexity constraints for f, while DCAe relaxes both assumptions.\n\nStep 3: Impact on applicability:\n- pDCAe is restricted to problems where f is convex and smooth, limiting its use to well-behaved objective functions.\n- DCAe's weaker assumptions allow application to Problem (1) with non-convex/non-smooth f, making it suitable for more complex optimization scenarios typical in DC programs where smoothness and convexity cannot be guaranteed.\n\nQID: Management-table-460-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-460-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately identifies the differences in assumptions between DCAe and pDCAe and correctly explains how these differences impact the applicability of each method to Problem (1), matching the gold answer in both content and reasoning.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-460-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer accurately identifies the differences in assumptions between DCAe and pDCAe and correctly explains how these differences impact the applicability of each method to Problem (1), matching the gold answer in both content and reasoning."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-460-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer accurately identifies the differences in assumptions between DCAe and pDCAe and correctly explains how these differences impact the applicability of each method to Problem (1), matching the gold answer in both content and reasoning."}

Specifically, verify whether $t = 0$ is an irregular accumulation point by examining the limit of the solution set as $t \\to 0^+$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo verify that $t = 0$ is an irregular accumulation point, we analyze the behavior of the solution set as $t \\to 0^+$. The solution for $t > 0$ is given by $(x(t), y(t), z(t)) = (t, -t, -1)$ for $t \\in \\left(\\frac{1}{2k-1}, \\frac{1}{2k}\\right)$ and $(-t, t, -1)$ for $t \\in \\left(\\frac{1}{2k}, \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\right)$. As $t \\to 0^+$, the intervals $\\left(\\frac{1}{2k-1}, \\frac{1}{2k}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2k}, \\frac{1}{2k+1}\\right)$ become increasingly narrow. The solution oscillates between $(t, -t, -1)$ and $(-t, t, -1)$ infinitely often as $t \\to 0^+$. However, the limit of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ as $t \\to 0^+$ is 0, and $z(t) = -1$ for all $t > 0$. Thus, the solution set converges to $(0, 0, -1)$, but the path is highly oscillatory. This behavior, combined with the loss of inner semicontinuity at each $t_k = \\frac{1}{k}$, confirms that $t = 0$ is an irregular accumulation point.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the solution structure for t > 0.\nFor t ∈ (1/(2k-1), 1/(2k)), solutions are (t, -t, -1); for t ∈ (1/(2k), 1/(2k+1)), solutions are (-t, t, -1). At t = 1/k, solutions form a set { (α, -α, -1) | α ∈ [-t, t] }. All these solutions collapse to (0,0,-1) as t → 0⁺.\n\nStep 2: Observe accumulation behavior.\nThe points t = 1/k (where solutions become non-unique) accumulate at t = 0. Despite the unique limit (0,0,-1), these accumulating points with multi-valued solutions violate the nonsingular time condition.\n\nStep 3: Match to table classification.\nThe problem has LICQ (where solutions are unique) and continuous data but lacks nonsingular time due to accumulating singularities at t = 1/k. This matches the second row in the table, which associates such conditions with irregular accumulation points.\n\nConclusion: Since infinitely many non-unique solution points accumulate at t = 0 without forming a continuous path, t = 0 is an irregular accumulation point.\n\nQID: Management-table-546-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-546-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the oscillatory behavior and accumulation of non-unique solutions as t approaches 0, confirming t = 0 as an irregular accumulation point, matching the gold answer's analysis.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-546-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the oscillatory behavior and accumulation of non-unique solutions as t approaches 0, confirming t = 0 as an irregular accumulation point, matching the gold answer's analysis."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-546-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the oscillatory behavior and accumulation of non-unique solutions as t approaches 0, confirming t = 0 as an irregular accumulation point, matching the gold answer's analysis."}

The number of distinct columns $p$ is bounded by:\n$$\np \\leq (2nd + 1)^\\ell,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of nodes, $d$ is the maximum absolute value in matrix $A$, and $\\ell$ is the number of side constraints. This bound arises because each column $w^k = Au^k$ has entries in $\\{0, \\pm1, \\ldots, \\pm nd\\}^\\ell$. Since each iteration either adds a new distinct column or terminates, the scheme terminates in at most $(2nd + 1)^\\ell$ iterations. The complexity is polynomial in $n$ and $d$ for fixed $\\ell$, making the method practical for moderate-sized problems.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the ε-complementary slackness framework. The method maintains primal variables x_j and dual variables t_j satisfying f_j^−(x_j) − ε ≤ t_j ≤ f_j^+(x_j) + ε. The v-kilter number κ_j measures vertical deviation from the characteristic curve Γ_j.\n\nStep 2: Column generation mechanism. New columns (variables/paths) are generated only when they violate ε-kilter conditions, ensuring each added column significantly reduces the total v-kilter measure ∑κ_j.\n\nStep 3: Monotonic decrease guarantee. Each iteration strictly decreases the total vertical kilter measure due to the ε-relaxation mechanism, preventing cycling and ensuring progress toward ε-optimality.\n\nStep 4: Bound derivation via geometric convergence. The logarithmic term log(ε₀/ε) in the complexity table indicates that the number of columns grows proportionally to the required precision level. Polynomial factors (m², max{l,p}³, etc.) stem from problem dimension and side constraint structure.\n\nStep 5: Final complexity bound.

This shows the plain JAM's superior performance in reducing estimation error.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify row #15 data in Table 2 (labeled as \"Table 1\" in the question). For Time Scaling: bias = -0.009605, sample variance = 0.140894 (but use exact variance = 0.16 * (1 - 0.16) = 0.1344). For Plain JAM: bias = -0.000029, variance = 0.137683.\n\nStep 2: Compute RMSE for Time Scaling:\nRMSE_TS = √[(-0.009605)² + 0.1344] = √[0.00009225 + 0.1344] ≈ √0.134492 ≈ 0.3667.\n\nStep 3: Compute RMSE for Plain JAM:\nRMSE_JAM = √[(-0.000029)² + 0.137683] = √[8.41e-10 + 0.137683] ≈ √0.137683 ≈ 0.3711.\n\nStep 4: Compare results: Time Scaling RMSE ≈ 0.367, Plain JAM RMSE ≈ 0.371. While Plain JAM has marginally higher RMSE due to slightly larger variance, its bias (-0.000029) is 330x smaller than Time Scaling's bias (-0.009605).\n\nStep 5: Implications: Plain JAM significantly reduces bias at the cost of a small increase in variance.

Since the Night shift has the highest relative pay, we should minimize the number of workers assigned to it to reduce costs. Thus, set $n_n = 4$.\n2. The remaining workers to be assigned are $15 - 4 = 11$, which should be distributed between Day and Evening shifts.\n3. The Day shift has a lower relative pay (3.0) compared to the Evening shift (3.6), so to minimize costs, we should assign as many workers as possible to the Day shift.\n4. Therefore, set $n_d = 11$ and $n_e = 0$.\n5. The total labor cost is then calculated as:\n   $$ C = 3.0 \\times 11 + 3.6 \\times 0 + 4.5 \\times 4 = 33 + 0 + 18 = 51 $$\n\nThus, the optimal distribution is 11 workers on the Day shift, 0 workers on the Evening shift, and 4 workers on the Night shift, resulting in a total labor cost of 51 units.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the objective function and constraints.\nThe total labor cost is given by C = 3.0n_d + 3.6n_e + 4.5n_n, where n_d, n_e, and n_n are workers for Day, Evening, and Night shifts. Constraints: n_d + n_e + n_n = 15 and n_n ≥ 4.\n\nStep 2: Minimize costs by prioritizing cheaper shifts.\nSince Night shifts have the highest pay rate (4.5), assign the minimum required workers to Night (n_n = 4). This leaves 15 - 4 = 11 workers for Day and Evening shifts.\n\nStep 3: Distribute remaining workers to the cheapest shift.\nDay shifts have a lower rate (3.0) than Evening (3.6).

The total penalty for these violations must not exceed the penalty for violating one Level 1 wish: $w_3 \\cdot x_3 + w_4 \\cdot x_4 \\leq w_1$. Substituting the given values: $20 \\cdot x_3 + 4 \\cdot x_4 \\leq 15000$. To find the maximum number of violations, we can consider extreme cases. For example, if only Level 3 wishes are violated: $x_3 = \\lfloor 15000 / 20 \\rfloor = 750$. If only Level 4 wishes are violated: $x_4 = \\lfloor 15000 / 4 \\rfloor = 3750$. Combinations of $x_3$ and $x_4$ must satisfy the inequality $20x_3 + 4x_4 \\leq 15000$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the penalty values from the table. Level 1 has a penalty of 15,000 per violation. Level 3 has 20 per violation, and Level 4 has 4 per violation.\nStep 2: The total penalty for violating one Level 1 wish is 15,000. We need to find the maximum number of Level 3 + Level 4 violations where 20(L3) + 4(L4) ≤ 15,000.\nStep 3: To maximize the number of violations, prioritize Level 4 (lower penalty). If only Level 4: 15,000/4 = 3,750 violations. But since a combination is required:\nStep 4: Allocate 1 violation to Level 3: 20(1) = 20 penalty. Remaining penalty: 15,000 - 20 = 14,980.\nStep 5: Calculate Level 4 violations: 14,980/4 = 3,745. Total violations: 1 (L3) + 3,745 (L4) = 3,746.\nFinal Answer: 3,746 is the maximum number of combined Level 3 and Level 4 wishes that can be violated without exceeding the penalty of one Level 1 violation.\n\nQID: Management-table-178-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-178-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly follows the reasoning provided in the gold answer, calculating the maximum number of combined Level 3 and Level 4 wishes that can be violated without exceeding the penalty of one Level 1 violation.

The overall ratio provided in the 'Total' row is 71.2%, which is significantly lower than the weighted average. This discrepancy arises because the 'Total' ratio is calculated based on the total origination-and-destination passengers and total enplanements across all categories, whereas the weighted average treats each airport equally regardless of its size.

Interpret the result in the context of bank profitability.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the elasticity, we use the formula: $E = \\frac{\\% \\Delta NSF_{fees}}{\\% \\Delta Overdraft}$. For 'High-low' sequencing, NSF fees increase from $54.64 to $58.04 when overdraft increases from $100 to $200. The percentage change in NSF fees is $\\frac{58.04 - 54.64}{54.64} \\times 100 = 6.22\\%$. The percentage change in overdraft is $\\frac{200 - 100}{100} \\times 100 = 100\\%$. Thus, elasticity $E = \\frac{6.22}{100} = 0.0622$. This low elasticity indicates that NSF fees are relatively inelastic to changes in overdraft levels, suggesting that increasing overdraft limits has a modest impact on bank profitability under this sequencing policy.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify NSF fee values for 'High-low' policy:\n- At $100 overdraft: $54.64\n- At $200 overdraft: $58.04\n\nStep 2: Calculate percentage change in NSF fees:\n((58.04 - 54.64)/54.64) × 100 ≈ (3.4/54.64) × 100 ≈ 6.22%\n\nStep 3: Calculate percentage change in overdraft level:\n((200 - 100)/100) × 100 = 100%\n\nStep 4: Compute elasticity:\nElasticity = %ΔNSF Fees / %ΔOverdraft = 6.22%/100% = 0.062\n\nInterpretation: The elasticity of 0.062 indicates NSF fees are highly inelastic to overdraft level changes. A 100% increase in overdraft level only increases fees by ~6.2%. While this suggests banks gain modest additional fee revenue from overdraft increases under 'High-low' sequencing, the low responsiveness implies diminishing returns.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-526-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven the machine epsilon of $2.2204 \\times 10^{-16}$ and the problem sizes $n=100$, $n=1,000$, $n=402$, and $n=961$, how does the iGSM algorithm's computational complexity scale with problem size, and what implications does this have for solving the problems listed in Table 1?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo analyze the computational complexity of the iGSM algorithm, we consider the problem size $n$ and the machine epsilon $\\epsilon \\approx 2.2204 \\times 10^{-16}$. The iGSM algorithm's complexity can be modeled as $O(n^k)$, where $k$ depends on the problem structure. For the given problem sizes:\n\n1. For $n=100$, the complexity is $O(100^k)$.\n2. For $n=1,000$, it scales to $O(1,000^k)$.\n3. For $n=402$ and $n=961$, the complexities are $O(402^k)$ and $O(961^k)$, respectively.\n\nThe machine epsilon $\\epsilon$ ensures that the numerical errors are bounded, which is critical for convergence. The problems in Table 1, such as the Broyden tridiagonal function (BTF) and the Ornstein-Zernike equation (OZE), have structures that may allow $k$ to be less than or equal to 2, implying quadratic or near-linear scaling. Thus, the iGSM algorithm remains efficient even for large $n$, as evidenced by the successful experiments on problems up to $n=1,000$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify iGSM's computational complexity scaling.\nThe iGSM algorithm is described as efficient for large-scale systems, implying sub-cubic complexity. Structured problems in Table 1 (e.g., tridiagonal, banded systems) suggest per-iteration costs scale linearly or quadratically with n. For sparse systems, complexity likely scales near-linearly (O(n) or O(n log n)) due to efficient sparse matrix operations.\n\nStep 2: Analyze problem sizes.\nTested sizes (n=100, 402, 961, 1,000) span orders of magnitude. A near-linear scaling would mean computational effort increases proportionally to n (e.g., doubling n ≈ doubles effort), while quadratic scaling would show quadratic growth (e.g., 10× n → 100× effort). The algorithm's suitability for n=1,000 implies practical handling of quadratic or better scaling.\n\nStep 3: Connect to Table 1 implications.\nProblems like Chandrasekhar H-equation (CHR), convection-diffusion (CDE), and structured Jacobian systems benefit from iGSM's efficient scaling. Sparse/diagonal systems (TdS, FdS, SdS) further amplify efficiency gains. The machine epsilon (2.2204e-16) ensures numerical stability during iterations, avoiding error accumulation even for large n.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\niGSM's near-linear or moderate polynomial scaling with n makes it viable for high-dimensional systems in Table 1. This enables robust solutions for problems like OZE (n=402) and CDE (n=961) without prohibitive computational costs, emphasizing its advantage for structured large-scale systems over classical methods with worse scaling.\n\nQID: Management-table-526-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-526-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately describes the computational complexity scaling of the iGSM algorithm, aligns with the implications for solving problems in Table 1, and correctly references the role of machine epsilon.

Using the cost function $f_{e}(x)$, derive the theoretical upper bound for the competitive ratio of the online algorithm and compare it with the empirical average OLG value of 1.189.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the theoretical upper bound for the competitive ratio, we analyze the cost function $f_{e}(x) = \\sigma_{e} + x^{\\alpha_{e}}$ for $x > 0$.\n\n1. **Competitive Ratio Definition**: The competitive ratio $\\rho$ is defined as the maximum ratio of the online algorithm's cost to the optimal offline cost, i.e., $\\rho = \\frac{\\text{ALG}}{\\text{OPT}}$.\n\n2. **Upper Bound Derivation**: For continuous $\\alpha_{e} \\in [1.1, 3]$, the worst-case competitive ratio occurs when $\\alpha_{e} = 3$ (maximal diseconomies of scale). The fixed cost $\\sigma_{e}$ is chosen from $[1, (0.3 \\times 10)^3] = [1, 27]$.\n   - The online algorithm's cost can be bounded by considering the worst-case scenario where all requests are routed on a single edge, leading to $\\text{ALG} \\leq \\sigma_{e} + N^{\\alpha_{e}} = \\sigma_{e} + 10^{3}$.\n   - The optimal cost $\\text{OPT}$ is at least $\\sigma_{e}$ (if requests are distributed).\n   - Thus, $\\rho \\leq \\frac{\\sigma_{e} + 1000}{\\sigma_{e}} = 1 + \\frac{1000}{\\sigma_{e}}$.\n   - The maximum $\\rho$ occurs when $\\sigma_{e} = 1$, giving $\\rho \\leq 1 + 1000 = 1001$.\n\n3. **Comparison with Empirical Value**: The empirical average OLG is 1.189, which is significantly lower than the theoretical upper bound of 1001. This suggests that in practice, the online algorithm performs much better than the worst-case theoretical bound, likely due to the random distribution of $\\alpha_{e}$ and $\\sigma_{e}$ values and the uniform sampling of request pairs.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key parameters from the cost function $f_e(x) = \\sigma_e + x^{\\alpha_e}$. Continuous instances have $\\alpha_e \\in [1.1, 3]$ and $\\sigma_e \\in [1, (0.3N)^{\\alpha_e}]$ with $N=10$.\\n\\nStep 2: Recall that competitive ratio upper bounds for convex cost functions often depend on the maximum exponent $\\alpha_{\\text{max}}$. For $\\alpha_e \\leq 3$, theoretical upper bounds are typically proportional to $\\alpha_{\\text{max}}$.\\n\\nStep 3: For edge cost functions of the form $\\sigma_e + x^{\\alpha_e}$, worst-case analysis shows the competitive ratio is bounded by $\\alpha_{\\text{max}}$. Since continuous instances allow $\\alpha_e = 3$, the theoretical upper bound is 3.\\n\\nStep 4: Compare with empirical results. The table shows an average OLG ratio of 1.189 for N=10/C instances.

Round 1: Home (1-3)\n2. Round 2: Away (5-1)\n3. Round 3: Home (1-7)\n4. Round 4: Away (9-1)\n5. Round 5: Home (1-11)\n6. Round 6: Away (13-1)\n7. Round 7: Home (1-15)\n\nThe home-away pattern is H-A-H-A-H-A-H. A break occurs when a team plays two consecutive home or away games. Here, team 1 alternates perfectly, so there are 0 breaks in the first seven rounds.\n\nThe theoretical minimum number of breaks for a team in a league with $2n$ teams is $0$ if the schedule is perfect. For $2n+1$ teams, at least one break per team is unavoidable.

From Table 1, the proctor can be assigned to 8 locations with 2 shift types (two-hour or three-hour), plus the 'Not available' (X) and 'Free (not scheduled)' (0) options.

The Koyck estimate is lower by $0.0090$. The geometric decay assumption in the Koyck model implies that the effect of SL declines by a factor of $\\lambda$ each period, where $\\lambda = 0.348$.

Total Repositioning Cost becomes $180,000 - $25,000 = $155,000. 5. Add the bonus to Market Profit for LA-CH: $65,000 + (50 \\times $500) = $90,000. 6. New sum of Market Profits: $662,500 - $65,000 + $90,000 = $687,500. 7. New Total Network Profit: $687,500 - $155,000 = $532,500.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant dual values. The dual value at LA is -$200 per unit, and CH is $300 per unit.\nStep 2: Since we're increasing equipment availability at LA by 50 units, multiply the quantity change by LA's dual value: 50 units × (-$200/unit) = -$10,000.\nStep 3: The problem specifies this reduces LA-CH repositioning by 50 units. However, dual values already account for systemic network effects including repositioning changes.\nStep 4: The total profit change is determined solely by the LA dual value calculation (-$10,000), as dual values inherently incorporate all marginal impacts from constraint changes.\nFinal Change: The network profit would decrease by $10,000.\n\nQID: Management-table-241-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-241-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly focuses only on the LA dual value without accounting for the combined effect of LA and CH dual values on repositioning costs and market profits, as detailed in the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-241-1", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer incorrectly focuses only on the LA dual value without accounting for the combined effect of LA and CH dual values on repositioning costs and market profits, as detailed in the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-241-1", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer incorrectly focuses only on the LA dual value without accounting for the combined effect of LA and CH dual values on repositioning costs and market profits, as detailed in the gold answer."}

How does this compare to the PHB's high-cost scenario with a 250% contingency?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFor the 'Accelerator production of tritium (APT)':\n1. Base-case cost = $3,603 million.\n2. Oak Ridge's low contingency (30%): $3,603 \\times 0.30 = $1,080.9 million. Total cost = $3,603 + $1,080.9 = $4,683.9 million.\n3. Oak Ridge's high contingency (60%): $3,603 \\times 0.60 = $2,161.8 million. Total cost = $3,603 + $2,161.8 = $5,764.8 million.\n4. PHB's high-cost scenario (250% contingency): $3,603 \\times 2.50 = $9,007.5 million. Total cost = $3,603 + $9,007.5 = $12,610.5 million.\n\nComparison:\n- Oak Ridge's range: $4,683.9 to $5,764.8 million.\n- PHB's high-cost: $12,610.5 million.\nPHB's estimate is significantly higher, reflecting a more conservative (or risk-averse) approach to contingencies.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the base-case cost for APT from the table. The 'Accelerator production of tritium (APT)' has a base cost of $3,603 million.\n\nStep 2: Calculate ORNL's contingency range (30% to 60%).\n- Lower bound: $3,603M × (1 + 30%) = $3,603M × 1.3 ≈ $4,684M\n- Upper bound: $3,603M × (1 + 60%) = $3,603M × 1.6 ≈ $5,765M\n\nStep 3: Compute PHB's high-cost scenario with 250% contingency:\n$3,603M × (1 + 250%) = $3,603M × 3.5 ≈ $12,611M\n\nStep 4: Compare the ranges. The ORNL contingency range ($4,684M–$5,765M) is substantially lower than PHB's high-cost scenario ($12,611M).

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-475-1", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nFor the Covering problem, the 'Known' result under bounded migration shows a competitive ratio of $[2,2]$. How does the 'New' result under bounded reassignment improve upon this, and what does this imply about the trade-off between competitive ratio and reassignment factor?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe 'New' result for the Covering problem under bounded reassignment achieves a competitive ratio of $1+\\varepsilon$, which is a significant improvement over the 'Known' result of $[2,2]$ under bounded migration. This implies that by allowing a constant reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$, the algorithm can achieve a much better competitive ratio. The trade-off is that the reassignment factor increases as $\\varepsilon$ decreases, but the competitive ratio approaches the optimal value of 1.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the table entries for the Covering problem.\n- Known result under 'Bounded migration' shows a fixed competitive ratio of [2,2] (likely meaning both lower and upper bounds are 2).\n- New result under 'Bounded reassignment' improves this to 1+ε (an asymptotically optimal ratio).\n\nStep 2: Understand the trade-off mechanism:\n- Bounded migration limits total job movement proportional to the size of incoming/outgoing jobs but achieves weaker 2-competitiveness.\n- Bounded reassignment allows controlled job migrations (with reassignment factor r as a multiple of the total size of added/removed jobs) to enable (1+ε)-competitiveness.\n\nStep 3: Compare results:\nThe New result replaces the fixed 2-competitive ratio with a near-optimal (1+ε) ratio under bounded reassignment, where ε > 0 can be made arbitrarily small. This requires accepting a higher but controlled reassignment factor r(ε) (dependent on ε).\n\nStep 4: Implication of trade-off:\nThis demonstrates that relaxing the migration constraint to allow bounded reassignment (with r > 1) enables dramatically improved competitive ratios. The system designer can now balance solution quality (1+ε) against migration costs (r), where smaller ε (better ratios) generally require larger r (higher reassignment costs).\n\nQID: Management-table-475-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-475-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains the improvement from the 'Known' result to the 'New' result, detailing the trade-off between competitive ratio and reassignment factor, aligning perfectly with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-475-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the improvement from the 'Known' result to the 'New' result, detailing the trade-off between competitive ratio and reassignment factor, aligning perfectly with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-475-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the improvement from the 'Known' result to the 'New' result, detailing the trade-off between competitive ratio and reassignment factor, aligning perfectly with the gold answer."}

From the table, the mid-point net surplus for Q3 is 3. Assuming $NS_{t-1} = 29$ (from Q2), and using $M_t = \\frac{NS_t + NS_{t-1}}{2}$, we have $3 = \\frac{NS_t + 29}{2} \\Rightarrow NS_t = -23$.

Let $p(α)$ be the probability of crossing for angle $α$, and $L(α)$ be the average journey length for angle $α$.\n\n2. Given that the number of crossings is proportional to the square of the average journey length:\n   $$p(α) \\propto L(α)^2$$\n\n3. For $α = 85°$, the journey length $L(85°)$ is likely longer than for other angles, leading to:\n   $$p(85°) = k \\times L(85°)^2$$\n   where $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\n4. The higher $p(85°)$ suggests that $L(85°)$ is significantly larger than $L(α)$ for other $α$, causing $p(85°)$ to be higher due to the quadratic relationship.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that the adjusted probability p accounts for journey length differences using the formula p_adjusted = p_original × (L_known/L_simulated)^2, where L_known is the real average journey length and L_simulated is the simulated one.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that the number of crossings is proportional to L². This implies p_original (unadjusted probability) depends intrinsically on L_simulated², as crossings ∝ L_simulated².\n\nStep 3: Substitute p_original ∝ L_simulated² into the adjustment formula: p_adjusted ∝ (L_simulated²) × (L_known²/L_simulated²) = L_known². However, observed p_adjusted values vary with α, indicating L_simulated depends on α.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that L_simulated varies with angle α. At α = 85°, simulated trips likely have shorter lengths (smaller L_simulated). This increases the adjustment factor (L_known/L_simulated)^2 disproportionately.\n\nStep 5: Derive the relationship: p_adjusted ∝ 1/(L_simulated(α))². Since L_simulated decreases with increasing α, p_adjusted increases sharply at larger angles like 85°, explaining the observed spike.\n\nQID: Management-table-561-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-561-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's reasoning incorrectly suggests that shorter simulated journey lengths at α = 85° lead to higher adjusted probabilities, which contradicts the gold answer's correct assertion that longer journey lengths (L(85°)) cause higher p(85°) due to the quadratic relationship.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-561-2", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's reasoning incorrectly suggests that shorter simulated journey lengths at α = 85° lead to higher adjusted probabilities, which contradicts the gold answer's correct assertion that longer journey lengths (L(85°)) cause higher p(85°) due to the quadratic relationship."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-561-2", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's reasoning incorrectly suggests that shorter simulated journey lengths at α = 85° lead to higher adjusted probabilities, which contradicts the gold answer's correct assertion that longer journey lengths (L(85°)) cause higher p(85°) due to the quadratic relationship."}

Explain the mathematical relationship between $E(w^2)$ and $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$ that could lead to such divergent outcomes.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe variance of waiting time $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$ is related to $E(w^2)$ and $E(w)$ by the formula $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = E(w^2) - [E(w)]^2$. If optimizing $E(w^2)$ leads to a significant decrease in $E(w^2)$ but also causes $E(w)$ to increase, the variance could increase. For example, suppose initial $E(w) = 10$ and $E(w^2) = 120$, giving $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = 20$.

All other parameters are identical.  \nStep 2: The cost increase ratio is $\\frac{2672.19}{400.93} \\approx 6.66$.

This sub-linear growth implies M contributes to C through interactions with other cost-surface dynamics.\n\nStep 3: Mathematical sensitivity analysis.\nLet ΔC = C₈ − C₁ = 2271.26 and ΔM = 900.\n- The average sensitivity is ΔC/ΔM ≈ 2.52, meaning every 1-unit increase in M raises C by ~2.52 units under these conditions.\n- This proportionality suggests C has a term linear in M: C = kM + (other terms), where k ≈ 2.52 represents the false-alarm frequency or system vulnerability to false alarms.\n\nConclusion: The cost sensitivity to M is governed by a constant multiplier (k) derived from fixed system parameters.

This typically occurs when every complementary pair (x_i, F_i(x)) in the NLCP is represented through the labeling system.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Labeling Rules\nFrom the formula context:\n- For interior points (x ∈ Sⁿ), l(x) = min{i | z_i(x) = max_h z_h(x)} identifies the first maximizer of the NLCP's residual function.\n- For boundary points (x ∈ ∂Sⁿ), l(x) = min{i | x_i = 0 ∧ x_{i−1(mod n+1)} > 0} tracks zero components adjacent to positive components, encoding boundary complementarity.\n\nStep 3: Relate to Matrix Q and Vertex Generation\nThe matrix Q's structure (-1/+1 transitions between components) creates movement directions. Vertices yⁱ are built through Q-column combinations (via ∑a_jq(j)/d), enforcing systematic exploration of complementary configurations.\n\nStep 4: Completion ↔ NLCP Solution Connection\nA complete simplex must contain:\n1. At least one vertex with label i for each complementary pair\n2. Labels corresponding to both zero variables (x_i = 0) and binding constraints (F_i(x) = 0)\nThis guarantees Brouwer's fixed-point theorem conditions are met within the simplex, implying existence of x ∈ σ where x and F(x) satisfy x_iF_i(x)=0 ∀i.\n\nStep 5: Algorithm Implementation\nGeneral labellings allow lower-dimensional motion on both boundary/interior (per heading).

Taking the derivative with respect to $a$ and setting it to zero: $$\\frac{d\\rho}{da} = -\\frac{C\\lambda}{a^2} + \\frac{h}{2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{C\\lambda}{a^2} = \\frac{h}{2} \\implies a^{*} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2C\\lambda}{h}}.$$ Substituting $a^{*}$ back into the primal constraint: $$\\rho^{*} \\frac{a^{*}}{\\lambda} \\leq C + \\frac{h}{2\\lambda} (a^{*})^2.$$ Since $\\rho^{*} = \\frac{C\\lambda}{a^{*}} + \\frac{h a^{*}}{2} = \\sqrt{2C\\lambda h}$, we have: $$\\sqrt{2C\\lambda h} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2C\\lambda}{h}}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2C\\lambda}{\\lambda} = 2C.$$ The right-hand side is: $$C + \\frac{h}{2\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{2C\\lambda}{h} = C + C = 2C.$$ Thus, the constraint holds with equality, verifying the optimality of $a^{*}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the cost function to minimize.

For the three time origins:\n1. $t_0 = 0$: $CV = \\frac{\\sqrt{17.4}}{14.6} \\approx 0.29$\n2. $t_0 = 30$: $CV = \\frac{\\sqrt{19.3}}{14.7} \\approx 0.30$\n3. $t_0 = 60$: $CV = \\frac{\\sqrt{37.3}}{14.7} \\approx 0.42$\n\nThe significant increase in CV for $t_0 = 60$ indicates high sensitivity to time origin, which undermines the reliability of the model. This suggests that microscopic traffic properties (e.g., bunching) are highly dependent on the choice of time slicing, making it challenging to draw consistent macroscopic conclusions without extensive data.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) for each time origin using the formula CV = √(variance/mean).\n- For t=0: CV = √1.19 ≈ 1.09\n- For t₀=30: CV = √1.32 ≈ 1.15\n- For t₀=60: CV = √2.54 ≈ 1.59\n\nStep 2: Analyze sensitivity to time origin.\nThe CV increases significantly with later time origins (1.09 → 1.15 → 1.59), indicating greater relative dispersion in vehicle arrivals when the time origin shifts. This suggests traffic bunching becomes more pronounced over larger time intervals.\n\nStep 3: Assess model reliability.\nThe two-state Markov model assumes uniform arrivals within discrete intervals. The observed time-origin sensitivity reveals:\n1. The model struggles to maintain consistent variance-mean relationships across time alignments\n2. Increased CV at t₀=60 implies stronger departure from Poisson assumptions (where variance/mean ≈ 1)\n3.

Assume the average degree of each node in $G$ is $d$ and the number of aircraft is $|P|$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the computational complexity, we analyze the ASH algorithm step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: For each disrupted aircraft $p^{*}$, initialize $l(p^{*}) = 0$ and $l(p) = \\infty$ for all other aircraft $p \\in P \\setminus \\{p^{*}\\}$. This step takes $O(|P|)$ time.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: ASH performs a BFS-like traversal to find shortest paths from $p^{*}$ to other aircraft. For each aircraft $p$ in the queue, it examines up to $d$ adjacent aircraft. The worst-case time complexity for BFS is $O(|P| + |E|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges. In a dense graph, $|E| = O(|P| \\cdot d)$, so the complexity becomes $O(|P| \\cdot d)$.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**: Whenever $p^{*}$ is found adjacent to an aircraft $p'$ in the queue, a cycle is detected. The cycle includes all aircraft on the path from $p^{*}$ to $p'$ plus the edge $(p', p^{*})$. The time to detect and process each cycle is proportional to the cycle length, which is bounded by $O(|P|)$.\n\n4. **Termination Condition**: The algorithm terminates when $|P'(p^{*})| \\geq \\text{MINPLANES}$ or all aircraft have been processed. In the worst case, it processes all $|P|$ aircraft.\n\nCombining these steps, the overall complexity is dominated by the BFS traversal, which is $O(|P| \\cdot d)$. Since the algorithm must run for each disrupted aircraft $p^{*} \\in P^{*}$, the total complexity is $O(|P^{*}| \\cdot |P| \\cdot d)$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the ASH algorithm's cycle-finding mechanism. ASH performs a BFS-like search from disrupted aircraft p*, maintaining shortest paths and predecessor relationships. When a cycle (path back to p*) is detected, aircraft in that cycle are added to P'(p*).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the BFS traversal complexity. Each node (aircraft) has average degree d, meaning each aircraft has d potential neighbors. In BFS, each node and edge is visited once, leading to O(|P| + |E|) complexity. With |E| ≈ |P|d (average degree), this becomes O(|P|d).\n\nStep 3: Consider MINPLANES termination condition. The algorithm stops when either:\n1) |P'(p*)| ≥ MINPLANES (sufficient aircraft collected), or\n2) All |P| aircraft are processed (worst case)\n\nStep 4: Determine worst-case complexity. Even when MINPLANES requires extensive searching, the algorithm must process up to all |P| nodes with d operations per node. This results in O(|P|d) complexity per disrupted aircraft p*.\n\nFinal Complexity: The computational complexity of finding all required cycles for a single disrupted aircraft p* is O(|P|d), driven by the BFS traversal through the graph with average degree d and |P| nodes.\n\nQID: Management-table-654-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-654-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the computational complexity as O(|P|d) for a single disrupted aircraft, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about BFS traversal and average node degree.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-654-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the computational complexity as O(|P|d) for a single disrupted aircraft, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about BFS traversal and average node degree."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-654-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the computational complexity as O(|P|d) for a single disrupted aircraft, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about BFS traversal and average node degree."}

This reflects the different cash flow structures of these securities, where IO cash flows are highly dependent on prepayment rates, while MBS cash flows are more stable.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand elasticity formula\nElasticity = (% Change in Price) / (% Change in PSA)\n\nStep 2: Calculate elasticity for each security\nFor MBS (350 → 385 PSA):\nElasticity = (-0.53%)/10% = -0.053\nFor MBS (350 → 315 PSA):\nElasticity = (0.61%)/(-10%) = -0.061\n\nFor IO (350 → 385 PSA):\nElasticity = (-8.89%)/10% = -0.889\nFor IO (350 → 315 PSA):\nElasticity = (10.42%)/(-10%) = -1.042\n\nFor PO (350 → 385 PSA):\nElasticity = (3.08%)/10% = 0.308\nFor PO (350 → 315 PSA):\nElasticity = (-3.44%)/(-10%) = 0.344\n\nStep 3: Analyze sensitivity\n- MBS shows low negative elasticity (-0.05 to -0.06): Least sensitive, inverse relationship\n- IO shows high negative elasticity (-0.89 to -1.04): Most sensitive, strong inverse relationship\n- PO shows positive elasticity (0.31-0.34): Moderate sensitivity, direct relationship\n\nConclusion: IO prices are highly sensitive to prepayment changes (accelerated prepayments hurt IO holders), PO benefits from faster prepayments, and MBS shows minimal price sensitivity as it combines both principal and interest components.\n\nQID: Management-table-259-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-259-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's calculations are correct, but their interpretation of the MBS elasticity signs is incorrect (they should be -0.053 and +0.061, not both negative).

Using the formula $E[Y_{i}(\\infty)] = \\phi/(\\mu - \\phi)$, calculate the theoretical steady-state expectation for station 1 and compare it with the simulation estimation. Assume $\\phi = \\lambda$ for station 1.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify $\\lambda$ for station 1, which is 0.2140. Thus, $\\phi = 0.2140$.\nStep 2: Given $\\mu = 1.0000$, compute $E[Y_{1}(\\infty)] = \\phi/(\\mu - \\phi) = 0.2140 / (1.0000 - 0.2140) = 0.2140 / 0.7860 \\approx 0.2723$.\nStep 3: The simulation estimation should be compared against this theoretical value.

Interpret this result in terms of estimator precision.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe relative efficiency of OLS compared to IML (W3) is the ratio of their variances: $$\\frac{(0.0064)^2}{(0.0030)^2} = \\frac{0.00004096}{0.000009} \\approx 4.55$$. This indicates that the OLS estimator is approximately 4.55 times more efficient in terms of variance than the IML (W3) estimator. However, this apparent efficiency of OLS is misleading because it ignores spatial autocorrelation, leading to underestimated standard errors. The IML method, while less efficient, provides correct standard errors by accounting for spatial dependence.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate variances by squaring the standard errors.\n- OLS variance: (0.0030)² = 0.000009\n- IML (W3) variance: (0.0064)² = 0.00004096\n\nStep 2: Compute relative efficiency as IML variance / OLS variance.\n- Relative efficiency = 0.00004096 / 0.000009 ≈ 4.55\n\nStep 3: Interpret the result.\nA relative efficiency of ~4.55 means the OLS estimator is approximately 4.55 times more efficient than the IML (W3) estimator.

Then, the wealthiest district has $14.096x$.\nStep 2: Assume state aid per ADA is inversely proportional to local resources. Thus, $\\text{State Aid} = \\frac{k}{\\text{Local Resources}}$.\nStep 3: For the wealthiest district, $545 = \\frac{k}{14.096x}$.

How does this ratio impact the operational efficiency and potential cancellation rates under the ARO framework?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the average number of flights per plane for Fleet 1 and Fleet 2, we use the formula: \n\n$\\text{Average flights per plane} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Flights}}{\\text{Number of Planes}}$\n\nFor Fleet 1: \n$\\frac{469}{96} \\approx 4.885$ flights per plane.\n\nFor Fleet 2: \n$\\frac{302}{70} \\approx 4.314$ flights per plane.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Fleet 1 has 469 flights and 96 planes, so $469 / 96 \\approx 4.885$.\n2. Fleet 2 has 302 flights and 70 planes, so $302 / 70 \\approx 4.314$.\n\nImpact on operational efficiency:\n- A higher average number of flights per plane (as in Fleet 1) indicates more intensive use of each aircraft, which could lead to higher stress on maintenance schedules and a higher likelihood of delays or cancellations if disruptions occur.\n- Under the ARO framework, Fleets with higher utilization rates may benefit more from the delay-tolerant routing, as cancellations are minimized by allowing controlled delays. However, the marginal increase in delays (e.g., for Fleet 3) must be managed to avoid excessive passenger disruptions.\n\nThis ratio directly affects the cancellation rates because fleets with higher utilization (like Fleet 1) may experience more frequent disruptions, but ARO's delay policies can mitigate cancellations by redistributing delays across the network.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract Fleet 1 and Fleet 2 data from Table 4:\n- Fleet 1: 96 planes, 469 flights\n- Fleet 2: 70 planes, 302 flights\n\nStep 2: Calculate average flights per plane:\n- Fleet 1 = 469 flights ÷ 96 planes ≈ 4.885 flights/plane\n- Fleet 2 = 302 flights ÷ 70 planes ≈ 4.314 flights/plane\nRatio ≈ 4.885:4.314 ≈ 1.13:1\n\nStep 3: Analyze operational efficiency impact:\nHigher flights/plane (Fleet 1) indicates tighter scheduling with less buffer. Under ARO's 3-hour delay allowance, this ratio suggests Fleet 1 has higher aircraft utilization but may require more proactive delay management to prevent exceeding maintenance delay thresholds (8% of arrivals triggering 2-day delays).\n\nStep 4: Cancellation rate implications:\nThe 13% higher flights/plane ratio in Fleet 1 increases exposure to cascading delays. However, ARO reduces cancellations by prioritizing delays over cancellations (equating 1 cancellation to 3-hour delay) and using aircraft swaps. This explains why ARO maintained lower cancellation rates despite Fleet 1's higher operational intensity, as evidenced by 2,206 resolved instances for Fleet 2 vs. Fleet 1's 16-second average solve time.\n\nQID: Management-table-672-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-672-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a detailed analysis of operational efficiency and cancellation rates under the ARO framework, aligning with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-672-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a detailed analysis of operational efficiency and cancellation rates under the ARO framework, aligning with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-672-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a detailed analysis of operational efficiency and cancellation rates under the ARO framework, aligning with the gold answer."}

The full model has $F=4.9$ with 36 variables, and the stepwise has $F=12.7$ with 12 variables. Assuming the same error sum of squares (SSE), calculate the ratio of the regression sum of squares (SSR) between the stepwise and full models.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The $F$-statistic formula is $F = \\frac{\\text{SSR}/k}{\\text{SSE}/(n-k-1)}$. Step 2: For the full model: $4.9 = \\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{full}}/36}{\\text{SSE}/(n-36-1)}$. Step 3: For the stepwise model: $12.7 = \\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{step}}/12}{\\text{SSE}/(n-12-1)}$. Step 4: Since SSE is constant, we can express the ratio as $\\frac{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{step}}}{\\text{SSR}_{\\text{full}}} = \\frac{12.7 \\times 12 \\times (n-36-1)}{4.9 \\times 36 \\times (n-12-1)}$.

For M1, the total iterations are 898,307 (86.36% of M0), for M2 they are 933,079 (89.72% of M0), and for M3 they are 893,218 (85.87% of M0). The differences arise because M1 uses the network simplex method, which is more efficient per iteration than the special simplex method. M2 uses the modified network simplex method, which is less efficient than M1's method but still better than M0. M3 combines both methods, leading to the lowest percentage of iterations, as it leverages the strengths of both approaches to minimize the number of costly special simplex iterations.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant data in the table for Problem Category E with K=7:\n- M0 Avg: 729.45 iterations (baseline 100%)\n- M1: Avg 222.88 iterations (30.59% of M0)\n- M2: Avg 412.53 iterations (56.61% of M0)\n- M3: Avg 208.12 iterations (28.53% of M0)\n\nStep 2: Compare percentages:\n- M1 requires ~30.6% of M0's iterations\n- M2 requires ~56.6% of M0's iterations\n- M3 requires ~28.5% of M0's iterations\n\nStep 3: Mathematical reasoning for differences:\n1. M1's 30.6% performance stems from using a modified network simplex method that likely improves pivot selection efficiency through better cycle detection and parametric cost management, reducing required iterations.\n\n2. M2's higher 56.6% percentage indicates it uses a hybrid approach that maintains more iterations from the original network simplex method (N_n) while incorporating some optimizations, trading iteration count for other computational efficiencies.\n\n3. M3's best performance (28.5%) comes from combining modified network simplex with a special simplex method (N_s) optimized for side constraints. This dual optimization reduces degenerate iterations through constraint prioritization and adaptive basis management.\n\nStep 4: Pattern analysis:\nThe descending percentages (M3 < M1 < M2) align with increasing algorithmic sophistication - M3 handles side constraints natively, M1 improves core network optimization, while M2 preserves more original method characteristics. The improved methods reduce redundant iterations through better feasibility maintenance and reduced cycling.\n\nQID: Management-table-439-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-439-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer provides incorrect iteration counts and percentages compared to the gold answer.

The percentage increase is $\\frac{10.7-8.6}{8.6} \\times 100 = 24.42\\%$. Step 2: Verify using formulas. For the island scenario, $E(S)=\\frac{2}{0.20}(e^{0.20 \\times 3}-1)=2 \\times (e^{0.6}-1)=2 \\times (1.8221-1)=1.6442$ sec. $\\mathrm{var}(S)=2 \\times \\frac{1}{0.20^2}[e^{1.2}-0.6e^{0.6}-1]=50 \\times (3.3201-1.0934-1)=50 \\times 1.2267=61.335$.

As $n/N \\to 0$, $a(n/N) \\to \\infty$, making the stopping criterion $I_i(\\hat{\\theta}_{in}, \\theta_i) > n^{-1}a(n/N)$ more stringent.

Step 2: For $l^{*}=0$, Overtime Property B of Kunreuther and Morton [9] states that overtime is never used. Step 3: This implies that the production planning model must rely solely on hiring and firing to meet demand fluctuations, as overtime is not a feasible option. The model must optimize the trade-off between hiring and firing costs to minimize total costs under this constraint.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify Key Parameters in Table 2\n- The 'Overtime' row in the Complete Design shows a value of 3, which likely represents the overtime cost parameter configuration.\n- Formula context specifies that overtime feasibility depends on parameter \\( l^* \\), which is zero when overtime becomes uneconomical compared to workforce adjustments.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Cost Relationships\n- Hiring (\\( h \\)) and firing (\\( f \\)) costs have a fixed 7:3 ratio (per formula context). Their sum \\( h + f \\) is critical for evaluating overtime feasibility.\n- Table 2's Reduced Design \"Cost Experiments\" column lists \"Costs = 6,\" indicating higher overall cost settings compared to the Complete Design (Costs = 3).\n\nStep 3: Derive Condition for \\( l^* = 0 \\)\n- Overtime is precluded when overtime cost (\\( o \\)) exceeds the combined cost of hiring/firing adjustments. For \\( l^* = 0 \\), the condition is:\n  \\[ o > h + f \\]\n- In Table 2’s Reduced Design Cost Experiments (Costs = 6), elevated cost parameters likely enforce this inequality, making workforce adjustments cheaper than overtime.\n\nStep 4: Implications for Production Planning\n- When \\( l^* = 0 \\), the model must rely solely on hiring/firing to meet demand fluctuations. This leads to:\n  1. Increased workforce volatility (more frequent hiring/firing cycles).\n  2. Higher total workforce adjustment costs but avoidance of costly overtime.\n  3.

How does this efficiency change with increasing dimensions?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFor dimension $15 \\times 5$, the average iterations for ZO-RGD are $460 \\pm 137$ and for RGD are $442$. The relative efficiency can be calculated as $\\frac{460}{442} \\approx 1.041$, indicating ZO-RGD requires about 4.1% more iterations on average. Considering the standard deviation, the 95% confidence interval for ZO-RGD iterations is $460 \\pm 2 \\times 137$, i.e., $[186, 734]$. Thus, the efficiency ratio ranges from $\\frac{186}{442} \\approx 0.421$ to $\\frac{734}{442} \\approx 1.661$. For higher dimensions ($25 \\times 15$ and $50 \\times 20$), the efficiency ratios are $\\frac{892}{852} \\approx 1.047$ and $\\frac{255}{236} \\approx 1.081$, respectively, showing a slight decrease in efficiency as dimensions increase.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant data from the table for 15×5 dimensions. ZO-RGD requires 460 ± 137 iterations, while RGD requires 442 iterations.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the base relative efficiency ratio as RGD_iterations / ZO-RGD_mean_iterations ≈ 442/460 ≈ 0.9609. This implies ZO-RGD is ~96.1% as efficient as RGD on average.\n\nStep 3: Account for ZO-RGD's standard deviation (±137). Efficiency bounds become:\n- Upper bound: 442/(460 - 137) ≈ 1.37 (best-case ZO-RGD)\n- Lower bound: 442/(460 + 137) ≈ 0.74 (worst-case ZO-RGD).\n\nStep 4: Analyze trends for increasing dimensions:\n- At 25×15: 852/892 ≈ 0.955 (stdev ±99 → tighter bounds)\n- At 50×20: 236/255 ≈ 0.925 (stdev ±26 → narrower spread).\n\nConclusion: Relative efficiency of ZO-RGD decreases (from ~96% → ~92.5%) as dimensions grow, while variability reduces.

The cost difference is $1.45 - 1.28 = 0.17$ per barrel, indicating bagged berries are more expensive due to additional labor and bag costs.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate Frostway's bulk berry cost per barrel:\nFreight Cost ($0.25) + Initial Cost ($0.81) + Continuing Monthly Cost ($0.22) = $0.25 + $0.81 + $0.22 = $1.28 per barrel.\n\nStep 2: Examine Farmers' bagged berry costs:\nFreight ($0.29) + Initial Cost ($0.76) + Continuing Monthly Cost ($0.23) = $1.28 base cost.\n\nStep 3: Identify missing components for bagged berries:\nThe formula requires adding labor (L) and bag (B) costs, but these values are not provided in the table for Farmers. This makes full comparison impossible with the given data.\n\nConclusion: Frostway's bulk berries cost $1.28/barrel. Farmers' bagged berries have identical base costs ($1.28) but would require additional unknown labor and bag expenses to determine their full cost advantage/disadvantage.\n\nQID: Management-table-378-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-378-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the total cost for bulk berries at Frostway ($1.28/barrel) but incorrectly stated that Farmers' bagged berries have identical base costs.

Then project the 2003 value assuming this growth rate remains constant, and compare it to the actual 2002 estimate. What economic factors might explain any discrepancy?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\n1. 2000 insurance value: 329.600\n2. 2001 insurance value: 433.400\n3. Growth rate = $(433.400 - 329.600)/329.600 ≈ 0.315$ or 31.5%\n\nProjection for 2003:\n1. 2002 estimate: 574.000\n2. Projected 2003 = 574.000 × (1 + 0.315) ≈ 574.000 × 1.315 ≈ 754.810\n\nComparison to 2002 estimate (574.000): The projection suggests extremely rapid growth. Potential discrepancies could arise from:\n- Market saturation in insurance products\n- Economic slowdown affecting disposable income\n- Regulatory changes in insurance sector\n- Shift of investments to other asset classes (as seen in mutual fund growth)\n\nThe high 2000-2001 growth rate may have been exceptional due to specific market conditions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate 2000–2001 growth rate for life/general insurance assets. 2000 value = 329.600; 2001 value = 433.400. Using CAGR formula: (433.4/329.6)^(1/1) - 1 = 31.5% annual growth rate.\n\nStep 2: Project 2003 value using constant 31.5% growth. Starting from 2001's 433.400:\n- 2002 projection: 433.4 × 1.315 = 570.1\n- 2003 projection: 570.1 × 1.315 ≈ 750.7\n\nStep 3: Compare with actual 2002 estimate (574.000). The projected 2002 value (570.1) is 0.7% lower than the actual 2002 value, indicating faster growth than the historical rate.\n\nEconomic factors for discrepancy:\n1. Accelerated demand for private insurance due to Italy's welfare state decline (per heading context)\n2. Improved financial product accessibility\n3. Market volatility affecting asset valuations\n4. Policy changes impacting insurance sector growth\n5. Consumer behavior shifts toward risk mitigation strategies.\n\nQID: Management-table-30-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-30-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the growth rate, projected the 2003 value, and compared it to the 2002 estimate.

Verify the provided clinic capacity of 307 residents per hour and explain any discrepancies.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the overall clinic capacity, we identify the station with the lowest constraint value, which is the bottleneck. From the table, the constraints are: Triage (463), Registration (4567), Education (617), Screening (574), Consultation (437), Vaccination (307), Symptoms (1037), Contact (498). The lowest constraint is Vaccination at 307 residents per hour, which matches the provided value. However, the Consultation station has a constraint of 437, which is higher than Vaccination, so no discrepancy exists. The calculation is consistent with the bottleneck principle: $\\text{Overall Capacity} = \\min(C_i) = 307$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the constraint formula - Clinic capacity constraint for each station is calculated as C_i = Station Capacity (S_i) / Percentage Served (P_i as decimal).\nStep 2: Verify Vaccination Station calculation - S_i = 294 residents/hour, P_i = 95.8% (0.958). 294 ÷ 0.958 ≈ 307 residents/hour. This matches the table's constraint value.\nStep 3: Identify bottlenecks - The Vaccination Station shows the lowest constraint value (307) followed by Consultation (437).\nStep 4: Validate reported capacity - The lowest constraint (307) becomes the clinic's bottleneck capacity as per queueing theory.\nStep 5: Explain data discrepancy - Vaccination's '95.8 4.8' percentage appears to contain a formatting error (likely should be 95.8%), but the constraint calculation remains valid.

Using the data, derive the relationship between IP size and computational time per IP, and explain the trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract time per IP from Table 2:\n- IP size 200: 108 IPs in 288s → 2.67s/IP\n- IP size 300: 9 IPs in 4,882s → 542.44s/IP\n- IP size 400: 1 IP in 3,671s → 3,671s/IP\n- IP size 500: 1 IP in 3,601s → 3,601s/IP\n- IP size 600: 1 IP in 3,601s → 3,601s/IP\n\nStep 2: Observe the exponential increase in time per IP as size grows, following roughly $time/IP \\approx k*e^{c*size}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze solution quality:\nPercentage improvement peaks at size 500 (2.97%) but isn't monotonic:\n- 200: 1.56%\n- 300: 1.48%\n- 400: 2.18%\n- 500: 2.97%\n- 600: 2.68%\n\nStep 4: The trade-off is clear - larger IPs can yield better solutions (up to 500) but require exponentially more time. The optimal balance depends on time constraints; size 400 offers a good compromise with 2.18% improvement in 3,671s versus 2.97% in 3,601s for size 500.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify p11.cri data points in Table 2.

Results show an inverse relationship between IP count and time per IP. Fewer IPs (indicating larger individual IPs due to parameter complexity) correlate with exponentially higher time per IP.\n\nStep 3: Analyze solution quality. Lower % gaps (e.g., 0.89% at α=0.1/γ=0.3 with 39 IPs) suggest better quality than higher gaps (e.g., 5.36% at α=0.1/γ=0.9), but parameters like α/γ also influence demand intervals and problem hardness.\n\nStep 4: Trade-off explanation. Larger IPs (fewer solved) demand more time per IP and may yield variable quality improvements. Smaller IPs enable solving more instances quickly, potentially exploring diverse solutions but risking suboptimal gaps.

Specifically, the vertices can be transformed via a unimodular transformation to the form: $$\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l l l l l}{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{1}&{1}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{0}&{1}&{0}&{\\beta}&{\\beta^{\\prime}}&{p}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}&{1}&{0}&{\\gamma}&{\\gamma^{\\prime}}&{q}\\end{array}\\right],$$ where $p$ and $q$ are coprime, and $(\\beta,\\gamma), (\\beta^{\\prime},\\gamma^{\\prime})$ satisfy $\\beta q - \\gamma p = 1$, $\\beta + \\beta^{\\prime} = p$, and $\\gamma + \\gamma^{\\prime} = q$.\n\nThe condition $\\beta q - \\gamma p = 1$ ensures that the parallelogram formed by $(0,0)$, $(\\beta,\\gamma)$, $(\\beta^{\\prime},\\gamma^{\\prime})$, and $(p,q)$ has area 1, which is necessary for the polyhedron to be integral. This condition guarantees that the lattice points on the two planes are adjacent and that no other lattice points lie between them.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Howe's Theorem characterizes integral polyhedra in 3-space by requiring vertices to have integer coordinates and satisfy specific Bézout-like conditions. The vertices are defined as $(0,0)$, $(\beta,\\gamma)$, $(\beta',\\gamma')$, and $(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime.\n\nStep 2: The conditions $\\beta + \\beta' = p$ and $\\gamma + \\gamma' = q$ ensure non-negative integer partitions of $p$ and $q$. This preserves lattice structure across the polyhedron.\n\nStep 3: The critical condition $\\beta q - \\gamma p = 1$ arises from Bézout's identity. Since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, this guarantees integer solutions $(\\beta,\\gamma)$, ensuring edges between vertices form a unimodular basis.\n\nStep 4: Unimodularity (determinant ±1) ensures the polyhedron is \\u0022primitive\\u0022 in the lattice, with no interior lattice points. This makes the polyhedron integral, as all vertices are lattice points and edges preserve integrality.\n\nSignificance: The equation $\\beta q - \\gamma p = 1$ acts as a certificate of integrality, linking number theory (coprimality via Bézout) to geometric lattice properties in 3-space.\n\nQID: Management-table-674-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-674-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately summarizes Howe's Theorem, including the characterization of integral polyhedra and the significance of the condition βq - γp = 1.

The key insight is that generalized weighted Shapley value rules induce potential games, where the potential function $\\Phi$ satisfies $U_{i}(a) - U_{i}(a') = \\lambda_{i} (\\Phi(a) - \\Phi(a'))$ for any unilateral deviation by player $i$. Potential games always admit pure Nash equilibria (the global maxima of $\\Phi$), and no broader class of games can guarantee equilibria universally. Thus, potential games are necessary to ensure equilibrium existence across all possible cost sharing games with fixed local welfare functions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that pure Nash equilibria (PNE) require players' utility improvements to have no profitable unilateral deviations. Potential games guarantee this through an ordinal potential function Φ where every unilateral improvement corresponds to an increase in Φ.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that cost-sharing games with arbitrary fixed local welfare functions W(S) require distribution rules where utilities align with a global potential structure. The theorem establishes necessity: only potential game structures can universally guarantee PNE existence across all possible W.\n\nStep 3: Analyze distribution rules in the table. Weighted Shapley values and their generalizations (f_GWSV^W) inherently create potential games through their weighted marginal contribution structure. These rules satisfy Φ(a) = ∑_{r∈R} W_r({a}_r) when aligned with the weight system ω=(λ,Σ).\n\nStep 4: Non-potential distribution rules (e.g., arbitrary non-Shapley allocations) lack a global Φ to align utilities. This could create cyclic best-response dynamics (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors scenarios) with no PNE. Thus, potential game structure becomes necessary to prevent such cycles and ensure equilibrium existence universally.\n\nStep 5: Conclude that Theorem 1's necessity stems from the requirement for payoff structures to mirror a potential function's gradient, which only occurs when the game is explicitly designed as a potential game through compatible distribution rules.\n\nQID: Management-table-476-4\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-476-4\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains the necessity of potential games for guaranteeing pure Nash equilibria in cost sharing games, aligning with the key insights from Theorem 1 as described in the gold answer.

How does this distribution impact the flexibility of the power system in terms of unit commitment and economic dispatch?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the average number of hydroelectric units per hydroelectric plant: $\\text{Average hydro units per plant} = \\frac{61}{19} \\approx 3.21$. For thermal units per thermal plant: $\\text{Average thermal units per plant} = \\frac{253}{111} \\approx 2.28$. The higher average of hydro units per plant suggests that hydro plants are more flexible in terms of unit commitment, as they can adjust output by varying the number of units in operation. The lower average for thermal plants indicates less flexibility, as fewer units per plant may limit the ability to ramp up or down quickly. This impacts economic dispatch by making hydro plants more responsive to demand fluctuations.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract relevant data from the table:\n- Hydroelectric plants: 19\n- Hydroelectric units: 61\n- Thermal plants: 111\n- Thermal units: 253\n\nStep 2: Calculate averages:\n- Hydro units/plant = 61 ÷ 19 ≈ 3.21 units/plant\n- Thermal units/plant = 253 ÷ 111 ≈ 2.28 units/plant\n\nStep 3: Analyze flexibility impact:\n1.

Higher hydro unit density improves granularity in economic dispatch, enabling better load-following capabilities and reserve management.\n3. Thermal's lower ratio implies larger output increments per unit change (fewer units to distribute generation across), reducing dispatch flexibility.\n4.

However, the difference of 0.10 is substantial relative to the scale (likely 0-1), suggesting a possible meaningful difference.\n\nStep 3: The heading text mentions that 'plans drawn for home care were better than those drawn for primary care,' which aligns with the higher 'Perceptions of solution quality' for Home Care (0.86 vs. 0.76). This supports the conclusion that home care plans were perceived as higher quality, despite the primary care plans containing more information.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate Mean Difference\nPerceptions of solution quality: Home Care (0.86) − Primary Care (0.76) = **0.10**.\n\nStep 2: Assess Statistical Significance\nNo p-value is reported in the 'Problem Method-Problem' or 'Interaction' columns for this measure. Since p-values for other measures (e.g., Method Effect for 'Likelihood of using' at 0.10) are explicitly listed when significant, the absence here suggests the difference is **not statistically significant** at conventional thresholds (α = 0.05 or 0.10).\n\nStep 3: Contextual Implications\nThe heading 'C. Problem Findings' implies a focus on meaningful discrepancies. Despite the observed 0.10 difference favoring Home Care, the lack of significance indicates this difference could be due to random variation rather than systemic factors. This weakens claims about problem severity in solution quality perceptions across care types. However, methodological limitations (e.g., small sample size, unobserved confounders) may still warrant further investigation if practical implications are suspected.\n\nQID: Management-table-755-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-755-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculates the mean difference, accurately assesses the lack of statistical significance due to missing p-value, and provides a nuanced discussion of implications, aligning closely with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-755-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculates the mean difference, accurately assesses the lack of statistical significance due to missing p-value, and provides a nuanced discussion of implications, aligning closely with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-755-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculates the mean difference, accurately assesses the lack of statistical significance due to missing p-value, and provides a nuanced discussion of implications, aligning closely with the gold answer."}

For dispersion, the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is appropriate. Assuming each organization's model count $x_i$ is known, $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu)^2}$, where $\\mu$ is the mean (2.34) and $N = 64$. Without individual data, dispersion cannot be calculated precisely.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: To estimate the average number of models per organization, divide the total number of models (over 150) by the total number of organizations (64). While the exact count is not provided, using 150 as a minimum gives an approximate average of 150 ÷ 64 ≈ 2.34 models per organization.

How would this deletion affect the constraints and objective function of the linear programming model designed to satisfy damage judgements?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the role of $B_j$ in the model. Typically, $B_j$ represents the number of bonds maturing in year $j$.\nStep 2: The constraint involving $B_j$ would be removed, simplifying the model. For example, if the constraint was $\\sum_{j} B_j \\cdot F_j \\geq D_j$ (where $D_j$ is the damage judgement in year $j$), this constraint would no longer apply for year $j$.\nStep 3: The objective function, which might minimize total cost $\\sum_{j} B_j \\cdot P_j$ (where $P_j$ is the price of bonds maturing in year $j$), would no longer include the term $B_j \\cdot P_j$.\nStep 4: The model's feasibility region is reduced, potentially making it easier to solve but also possibly excluding optimal solutions that involved bonds maturing in year $j$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Impact on the Objective Function\nIf no bonds mature in year 𝑗, the variable 𝐵𝑗 (representing bonds maturing in year 𝑗) is deleted. The objective function, which typically minimizes the total cost of bond purchases (e.g., ∑𝑃_𝑖𝐵_𝑖, where 𝑃_𝑖 is the bond price), would exclude the term associated with 𝐵𝑗. This reduces the number of variables in the objective.\n\nStep 2: Impact on Constraints\n- Cash Flow Constraints for Year 𝑗: The principal payment term 𝐹_𝑗𝐵_𝑗 (where 𝐹_𝑗 is the face value) is removed from the year 𝑗 constraint. The constraint now relies solely on coupon payments (𝐶_𝑗 terms) from bonds maturing in later years to meet the liability for year 𝑗.\n- Other Constraints: Non-negativity constraints (e.g., 𝐵𝑗 ≥ 0) or constraints explicitly tied to 𝐵𝑗 are eliminated. Constraints for other years remain unchanged unless they indirectly depend on 𝐵𝑗.\n\nStep 3: Feasibility Considerations\nIf coupons from remaining bonds are insufficient to satisfy the year 𝑗 liability, the model may require further adjustments (e.g., introducing new variables or recalculating constants like 𝐹_𝑗/𝐶_𝑗, as noted in Table 1).

Provide a step-by-step mathematical explanation.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe theoretical price $P$ of the MBS in the OAS model is given by:\n\n$$\nP=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}C_{n t}d_{n t},\n$$\n\nwhere the discount factor $d_{n t}$ is:\n\n$$\nd_{n t}=\\prod_{\\jmath=1}^{t}\\left(1+r_{n\\jmath}+O A S\\right)^{-1}.\n$$\n\nIf the OAS increases by 50 basis points (0.005), the new discount factor $d_{n t}^{\\text{new}}$ becomes:\n\n$$\nd_{n t}^{\\text{new}} = \\prod_{\\jmath=1}^{t}\\left(1 + r_{n\\jmath} + OAS + 0.005\\right)^{-1}.\n$$\n\nSince the denominator in the discount factor increases, each $d_{n t}^{\\text{new}}$ will be smaller than the original $d_{n t}$. This reduces the present value of each cash flow $C_{n t}$ in the sum. Consequently, the overall price $P$ will decrease because the average of the discounted cash flows is lower. The magnitude of the price decrease depends on the specific cash flow structure and the original OAS, but the direction is unambiguously downward.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the OAS pricing formula. The theoretical price P is calculated as the average present value of cash flows across all scenarios, discounted at (risk-free rate + OAS).\n\nStep 2: Recognize discount factor mechanics.

This suggests:\n1. Both methods struggle to maintain solution quality relative to the lower bound as inventory levels drop.\n2. Tabu search’s smaller gap (9.75%) indicates better scalability than Column Generation (18.67%), as its solutions remain closer to the theoretical minimum despite increasing problem complexity.\n\nQID: Management-table-572-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-572-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the percentage gaps (9.75% and 18.67%) but used a different method (percentage gap) than the absolute gap calculation in the gold answer (108.31 and 207.31).

Calculate the probability of MS/OR adoption and interpret the result in the context of the model.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nUsing the formula $P = \\frac{0.82}{1 + 0.82} = \\frac{0.82}{1.82} \\approx 0.4505$ or 45.05%. This matches the table value of 44.93% (difference due to rounding). Interpretation: A firm with low FUNCAREAS, high CUSTOM, and high LABOR has a 45.05% probability of adopting MS/OR methods, indicating that high customization and low functional areas negatively impact adoption despite a large workforce.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant row in Table 4 where ORAI=A, FUNCAREAS=L, CUSTOM=H, LABOR=H. This matches the third row with Expected Odds = 0.82.\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for probability: \\(P = \\frac{\\text{EXPECTED ODDS}}{1 + \\text{EXPECTED ODDS}}\\).\n\nStep 3: Substitute Expected Odds = 0.82 into the formula:\n\\(P = \\frac{0.82}{1 + 0.82} = \\frac{0.82}{1.82} \\approx 0.4493\\) or **44.93%**.\n\nStep 4: Interpretation: A firm with these characteristics (ORAI=A, FUNCAREAS=L, CUSTOM=H, LABOR=H) has a ~45% probability of adopting MS/OR. This indicates that under these conditions, the firm is slightly less likely to adopt MS/OR than not, reflecting the combined impact of its operational research activity (A), low functional areas specialization (L), high customization (H), and high labor intensity (H) according to the model.\n\nQID: Management-table-167-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-167-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the probability as 44.93% and provided a clear interpretation of the result, matching the gold answer's logic and conclusion.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-167-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the probability as 44.93% and provided a clear interpretation of the result, matching the gold answer's logic and conclusion."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-167-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the probability as 44.93% and provided a clear interpretation of the result, matching the gold answer's logic and conclusion."}

If the degrees of freedom for Vop is 3 and the total degrees of freedom is 39, calculate the critical F-value at a significance level of 0.05 and determine if the result is statistically significant.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine if the result is statistically significant:\n\n1. The critical F-value can be found using F-distribution tables or a calculator with $df_1 = 3$ (numerator degrees of freedom for Vop) and $df_2 = 39 - 3 = 36$ (denominator degrees of freedom, assuming total df is 39).\n2. For $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical F-value is approximately $2.87$.\n3. Compare the calculated F-value ($224.52$) to the critical F-value ($2.87$). Since $224.52 > 2.87$, the result is statistically significant at the $0.05$ level.\n\nAdditionally, the p-value of $0.0001$ is much less than $0.05$, further confirming the significance.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the degrees of freedom. The numerator df (Vop) is 3. The total degrees of freedom is 39. In ANOVA, total df = treatment df + error df. Thus, error df (denominator df) = 39 - 3 = 36.\nStep 2: Determine the critical F-value at α = 0.05 for F(3,36). Using an F-table or calculator, the critical F-value is approximately 2.86 (exact value depends on interpolation but falls between 2.84 and 2.92).\nStep 3: Compare the calculated F-value (224.52) with the critical value. Since 224.52 > 2.86, the F-value exceeds the critical threshold.\nStep 4: Confirm with the p-value. The p-value = 0.0001 < 0.05, which further confirms statistical significance.\nConclusion: The critical F-value is approximately 2.86.

What does this suggest about the impact of incorporating spatial autocorrelation?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe OLS estimate for β is 0.3244 with SE(β) = 0.0016 and R-square = 0.9967. The IML (W1) estimate is 0.3365 with SE(β) = 0.0039 and R-square = 0.9825. The higher standard error in IML (W1) indicates increased uncertainty when accounting for spatial autocorrelation, while the lower R-square suggests that the model fit is slightly reduced. This implies that spatial autocorrelation introduces additional variability not captured by OLS.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the 3 pm-4 pm (Y16) OLS and IML (W1) values from the table:\n- OLS: SE(β) = 0.0016, R² = 0.9967\n- IML (W1): SE(β) = 0.0039, R² = 0.9825\n\nStep 2: Compare standard errors (SE):\nIML (W1) has a larger SE (0.0039) than OLS (0.0016), indicating reduced precision in β estimates when spatial autocorrelation is incorporated.\n\nStep 3: Compare R-square values:\nIML (W1) has a lower R² (0.9825) than OLS (0.9967), suggesting OLS overestimates explanatory power by ignoring spatial dependencies.\n\nStep 4: Interpretation:\nThe results imply that spatial autocorrelation impacts model performance. Accounting for it (via IML) increases uncertainty in β estimates (higher SE) and reduces apparent model fit (lower R²), but provides more reliable estimates by addressing spatial dependence that OLS overlooks.

The $Q$ triangulation subdivides $S^{n}$ into $n$-simplices by using these direction vectors to define the vertices of the simplices. Specifically, an $n$-simplex $\\sigma(y^{1},...,y^{n+1})$ is formed by vertices satisfying $y^{i+1} = y^{i} + q(\\pi_{i})/d$ for a permutation $\\pi$ of $I^{n+1}$. This ensures that the simplices are adjacent and cover the entire simplex $S^{n}$ without overlap, facilitating the algorithm's movement through the subdivision.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Matrix Q is a fundamental component in constructing the Q-triangulation of the unit simplex Sⁿ. It serves as a directional transformation matrix with columns q(1),...,q(n+1) that define movement vectors between vertices in the triangulation.\n\nStep 2: The cyclical structure of Q (with 1s on the diagonal, -1s on the superdiagonal, and wrap-around elements in the last row) creates complementary direction vectors. These vectors enable transitions between adjacent vertices while maintaining the simplex constraints (∑x_i = 1).\n\nStep 3: In vertex computation formulas yⁱ = v + Σaⱼq(j)/d and yⁱ = yⁱ⁻¹ + q(π)/d, Q's columns govern incremental movements. Each q(j) represents a standardized direction for moving through adjacent subsimplices during triangulation.\n\nStep 4: The special anti-diagonal pattern (-1,0,...,1) in Q's last column facilitates boundary handling. This allows lower-dimensional movement on ∂Sⁿ (boundary) while maintaining consistency with interior navigation - a critical enhancement over previous methods limited to interior movement.\n\nStep 5: Through its column vectors and determinant properties, Q ensures that generated subsimplices maintain non-overlapping coverage of Sⁿ while preserving the simplicial structure.

This indicates that the observed difference in mean ATC-I (DB: 84.2 vs. Adaptive DB: 82.0) is not statistically significant, and any difference could be due to random variation.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Locate the relevant data for provider Ps1 under DB vs Adaptive DB scenarios in the table.\nStep 2: Observe the p-value of 0.352 listed for DB and Adaptive DB comparisons under Ps1.\nStep 3: Recall that a p-value > 0.05 indicates no statistically significant difference.\nStep 4: Note that 0.352 is substantially larger than the common alpha level of 0.05.\nStep 5: Conclude that the observed difference in ATC-I between DB (84.2) and Adaptive DB (82.0) for Ps1 is NOT statistically significant - the difference could reasonably be attributed to random chance rather than a true underlying difference in performance.\n\nQID: Management-table-205-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-205-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the p-value, compares it to the significance level, and concludes that the difference in ATC-I is not statistically significant, matching the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-205-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the p-value, compares it to the significance level, and concludes that the difference in ATC-I is not statistically significant, matching the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-205-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the p-value, compares it to the significance level, and concludes that the difference in ATC-I is not statistically significant, matching the gold answer."}

The CDF is $F(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$. The probability that the duration exceeds 15 minutes is $P(T > 15) = 1 - F(15) = e^{-\\lambda \\times 15}$.

On the boundary, the algorithm can traverse $(t-1)$-simplices where $t < n$, which is more efficient than moving through full-dimensional $n$-simplices. This is advantageous because solutions to the NLCP often lie on the boundary, and lower-dimensional movement can converge faster to these solutions. Additionally, the algorithm can handle general labellings that are not necessarily proper, making it more flexible and natural for describing complementarity conditions on the boundary.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand Algorithm Context\nThis algorithm extends van der Baan-Talman's approach by allowing general labellings. The key distinction lies in handling boundary points of simplex S through modified labeling rules.\n\nStep 2: Compare Movement Capabilities\n- Original algorithm: Restricted lower-dimensional movement (L-dim simplex traversal) to interior points\n- New algorithm: Permits L-dim movement on both boundary (∂S) and interior\n\nStep 3: Boundary Handling Mechanism\nOn ∂S, labeling rule l(x) = min{i | x_i=0 ∧ x_{i-1 mod(n+1)}>0} creates natural complementarity constraints. This allows:\n1. Navigation along boundary faces where variables are zero\n2. Proper handling of degeneracies through modified pivoting\n\nStep 4: Matrix Q Structure Analysis\nThe cyclic matrix Q = [1 -1 0...; 0 1 -1...; ...; -1 0...1] enables coordinate-aligned movement. On boundaries, this structure permits axis-constrained traversal through y^i = v + Σa_jq(j)/d calculations.\n\nStep 5: Advantages\n1. Natural NCP Solutions: Boundary movement directly handles complementarity conditions (x_i = 0 cases)\n2. Improved Efficiency: Avoids artificial interior detours for boundary solutions\n3. Enhanced Stability: Reduced cycling through compatible boundary/inner movement\n4. Generalization: Works for both proper and non-proper labellings across S\n\nStep 6: Computational Validation\nThe paper's experiments confirm general labellings with boundary movement better capture solution structures in NLCPs, particularly for sparse/noactive constraints at optimal points.\n\nQID: Management-table-542-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-542-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains the algorithm's handling of lower-dimensional simplicial movement on the boundary compared to the interior, detailing the mechanisms and advantages, which aligns with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-542-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the algorithm's handling of lower-dimensional simplicial movement on the boundary compared to the interior, detailing the mechanisms and advantages, which aligns with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-542-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the algorithm's handling of lower-dimensional simplicial movement on the boundary compared to the interior, detailing the mechanisms and advantages, which aligns with the gold answer."}

This means:\n1. The standard deviation is 162.5% of the average firm size\n2. There is substantial disparity between small and large firms\n3. The data is likely right-skewed (confirmed by median=12 being much lower than mean=28.3)\n4.

What does this imply about the time allocation between travel and activity participation?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFrom Table I, the average travel time to activity and back home is 37.81 minutes, and the average activity duration is 74.50 minutes. This implies that the time spent on the activity is approximately $\\frac{74.50}{74.50 + 37.81} \\approx 66.3\\%$ of the total time spent on the activity and travel, while travel time constitutes $\\frac{37.81}{74.50 + 37.81} \\approx 33.7\\%$.

For 'ILR (TU:90/RU:75)', the total cost is $730,699.62 and the number of shipments is 265. Thus, $\\text{CPS} = \\frac{730,699.62}{265} \\approx 2,757.36$.

The 'ILR (TU:90/RU:75)' policy has a higher CPS than the baseline, which seems counterintuitive given the 2.02% savings. However, the savings are calculated based on total cost, not CPS. The higher CPS indicates fewer but potentially more efficient shipments, contributing to overall cost savings despite the higher per-shipment cost.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify required data from the table\n- Find 'WW' baseline:\n  Total cost = $750,000.00\n  No. of shipments = 327\n- Find 'ILR (TU:90/RU:75)' policy:\n  Total cost = $730,699.62\n  No. of shipments = 265\n\nStep 2: Calculate Cost Per Shipment (CPS)\nFormula: CPS = Total cost ÷ Number of shipments\n- WW CPS = $750,000 ÷ 327 ≈ $2,293.58/shipment\n- ILR CPS = $730,699.62 ÷ 265 ≈ $2,757.36/shipment\n\nStep 3: Compare CPS values\nILR policy has 20.22% higher CPS than WW baseline ($2,757.36 vs $2,293.58)\n\nStep 4: Analyze percentage savings relationship\nThe table shows 2.02% savings for ILR despite higher CPS because:\n1. Fewer shipments (265 vs 327) reduce total trips\n2. Lower total cost ($730,699.62 vs $750,000)\n3.

Justify your answer using the reassignment factor framework.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nIn the 'Known' case, the competitive ratio for the Makespan problem with bounded reassignment and temporary jobs is in the interval $[?, 2+\\varepsilon]$. The 'New' result improves this to $1+\\varepsilon$. This improvement is achieved by maintaining a near-optimal assignment with a constant reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$. The reassignment factor ensures that the total cost of reassignments is proportional to the total size of added or deleted jobs, allowing the algorithm to adapt dynamically while maintaining a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-competitive ratio.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant entries in the table. Under the 'Makespan' row and 'Bounded reassignment (temporary jobs)' column:\n- 'Known' case entry: [?,2+ε]\n- 'New' result entry: 1+ε\n\nStep 2: Extract competitive ratios:\n- Known case competitive ratio: Upper bound = 2+ε (lower bound unknown)\n- New result competitive ratio: 1+ε\n\nStep 3: Compare results using reassignment factor framework:\nThe 'New' result improves upon the 'Known' upper bound by achieving (1+ε)-competitiveness (instead of 2+ε) while maintaining a constant reassignment factor r(ε). This matches the theoretical goal of maintaining near-optimal solutions (1+ε ratio) with bounded adaptation costs.\n\nStep 4: Justification through framework:\nThe improved competitive ratio demonstrates that with proper management of temporary jobs and bounded reassignment costs (controlled by r), we can now attain the ideal (1+ε)-competitiveness where previous results only achieved 2+ε.

Calculated EOQ (277 bags) is significantly lower than 600 bags.\n\nStep 4: Verify cost minimization\nTotal cost for 600 bags:\n- Ordering cost = 4×40 = 160 Rs\n- Holding cost = (600/2)×2.5×4 = 3,000 Rs\nTotal = 3,160 Rs\n\nTheoretical optimal (277 bags):\n- Orders = 2,400/277 ≈ 9\n- Ordering cost = 9×40 = 360 Rs\n- Holding cost = (277/2)×2.5×4 = 1,385 Rs\nTotal = 1,745 Rs\n\nConclusion: Suggested 600 bags does NOT minimize total cost. However, it represents the only feasible quantity under mixed truckload constraints (3 big +1 small), making it the practical solution despite higher costs.\n\nQID: Management-table-128-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-128-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the EOQ (277 bags) and demonstrated that the suggested 600 bags does not minimize total cost but is the practical solution under given constraints, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-128-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the EOQ (277 bags) and demonstrated that the suggested 600 bags does not minimize total cost but is the practical solution under given constraints, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-128-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the EOQ (277 bags) and demonstrated that the suggested 600 bags does not minimize total cost but is the practical solution under given constraints, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning."}

By the definition of the iterated difference operator, $(\\triangle^{n-k} z^{(k)})_{k} = \\sum_{s=0}^{n-k} (-1)^s \\binom{n-k}{s} z_{k+s}^{(k)}$.\n3. For $s = 0$, the term is $(-1)^0 \\binom{n-k}{0} z_{k}^{(k)} = z_{k}^{(k)}$.\n4. For $s > 0$, the terms $z_{k+s}^{(k)}$ are zero because $k + s > k$ component-wise, and by the corner point formula, $z_{j}^{(k;n)} = 0$ when $j > k$.\n5.

Substituting $k=1$: $(1+1)/2 = 1$; $k=3$: $(3+1)/2 = 2$; $k=5$: $(5+1)/2 = 3$. For $k=2,4,6$ (Replace_By_Any), the maximum number of patterns changed is $k/2$. Substituting $k=2$: $2/2 = 1$; $k=4$: $4/2 = 2$; $k=6$: $6/2 = 3$. The relationship shows that for odd $k$ (Replace_By_Unused), the formula is $(k+1)/2$, and for even $k$ (Replace_By_Any), it is $k/2$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the pattern for Replace_By_Unused operators (k=1,3,5). According to the formula context, these involve changes of up to (k+1)/2 patterns. For k=1: (1+1)/2=1 pattern; k=3: (3+1)/2=2 patterns; k=5: (5+1)/2=3 patterns. The expected number of patterns changed equals these values since these represent deterministic maximum changes.\n\nStep 2: Examine Replace_By_Any operators (k=2,4,6). The formula context states these involve up to k/2 patterns. For k=2: 2/2=1 pattern; k=4: 4/2=2 patterns; k=6: 6/2=3 patterns. The expected number matches these values for the same deterministic reasoning.\n\nStep 3: Establish the mathematical relationship. For odd k: max_patterns = (k+1)/2. For even k: max_patterns = k/2. This forms a stepwise linear relationship where max_patterns = ⌈k/2⌉ (ceiling function), indicating the maximum changes increase by 1 every 2 increments of k.\n\nConclusion: The expected number of patterns changed equals the maximum values derived from these formulas, and the relationship between k and max_patterns follows a ceiling function of k/2.\n\nQID: Management-table-426-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-426-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately derives the expected number of patterns changed for each $k$ and correctly explains the mathematical relationship between $k$ and the maximum number of patterns changed, matching the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-426-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately derives the expected number of patterns changed for each $k$ and correctly explains the mathematical relationship between $k$ and the maximum number of patterns changed, matching the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-426-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately derives the expected number of patterns changed for each $k$ and correctly explains the mathematical relationship between $k$ and the maximum number of patterns changed, matching the gold answer."}

In such models, coefficients represent elasticity - the percentage change in dependent variable for a 1% change in independent variable.\n\nStep 3: Apply the coefficient (0.152) to the 10% change. Since elasticity = %ΔY / %ΔX:\n%ΔY = 0.152 * 10% = 1.52%\n\nStep 4: Convert back to original scale. A 1.52% increase in log(travel_time) translates to a multiplicative effect of e^(0.152*0.10) ≈ 1.0153 (confirming ~1.52% increase).\n\nConclusion: A 10% increase in activity duration results in approximately 1.52% increase in expected travel time, all else being equal.\n\nQID: Management-table-676-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-676-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the log-log model structure, accurately applies the coefficient to calculate the 1.52% increase, and provides thorough reasoning that matches the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-676-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the log-log model structure, accurately applies the coefficient to calculate the 1.52% increase, and provides thorough reasoning that matches the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-676-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the log-log model structure, accurately applies the coefficient to calculate the 1.52% increase, and provides thorough reasoning that matches the gold answer."}

The percentage reduction is calculated as $\\frac{4.5 - 2.0}{4.5} \\times 100 = 55.56\\%$. \n\nAssuming a constant WIP level, the throughput $TH$ is inversely proportional to the cycle time $CT$, i.e., $TH \\propto \\frac{1}{CT}$. Thus, the throughput increases by $\\frac{1}{2.0} / \\frac{1}{4.5} = 2.25$ times, or a 125% increase.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify initial and final CTPL values for lines 4 and 5 from March 1996 to February 1997 using the table. The 'Highlights of Results' for this period show CTPL reduced from 4.5 to 2.0 days.\n\nStep 2: Calculate percentage reduction: ((Initial - Final)/Initial) × 100 = ((4.5 - 2.0)/4.5) × 100 = (2.5/4.5) × 100 ≈ 55.56%.\n\nStep 3: Throughput relationship: Throughput = WIP/Cycle Time (from Little’s Law). At constant WIP, throughput is inversely proportional to cycle time. A 55.56% reduction in cycle time means throughput increases by (1/(1−0.5556)) ≈ 2.25x or 125% improvement.\n\nQID: Management-table-94-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-94-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identified the initial and final CTPL values, accurately calculated the percentage reduction, and correctly explained the impact on throughput using Little's Law.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-94-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly identified the initial and final CTPL values, accurately calculated the percentage reduction, and correctly explained the impact on throughput using Little's Law."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-94-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly identified the initial and final CTPL values, accurately calculated the percentage reduction, and correctly explained the impact on throughput using Little's Law."}

What does the ratio $\\frac{t'(e)}{t(e)}$ indicate about the computational overhead?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo analyze the efficiency, we calculate the ratio of initial LP solution time to total solution time for each problem. For CS1: $\\frac{34.32}{32.11} \\approx 1.069$. For CS2: $\\frac{162.43}{84.26} \\approx 1.928$. The ratio indicates the proportion of time spent on the initial LP solution relative to the total time. A higher ratio (as in CS2) suggests greater computational overhead in solving the initial LP, which aligns with the conclusion that improving the LP code could reduce solution times significantly.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract t'(e) and t(e) values from Table 6.\n- For CS1: t'(e) = 34.32, t(e) = 32.11\n- For CS2: t'(e) = 162.43, t(e) = 84.26\n\nStep 2: Calculate the ratio t'(e)/t(e) for both problems:\n- CS1: 34.32 / 32.11 ≈ 1.07\n- CS2: 162.43 / 84.26 ≈ 1.93\n\nStep 3: Analyze the ratios:\n- A ratio >1 indicates the initial LP solution time exceeds the total solution time, which is unexpected since t(e) should include t'(e). This anomaly suggests either:\n  1) The initial LP computation dominates the process (unlikely given total time < LP time)\n  2) Subsequent algorithmic steps after the LP solve are highly efficient\n  3) Potential data reporting discrepancies\n\nStep 4: Interpret computational overhead:\nThe high ratios (particularly for CS2) imply significant time spent on the LP initialization relative to the total process. For CS2, the LP phase takes nearly twice the total runtime, suggesting either exceptional efficiency in later stages or substantial LP-related computational overhead that isn't adequately reflected in the total time metric.\n\nQID: Management-table-796-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-796-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the ratios and identified the computational overhead, but their reasoning about the anomaly (ratio >1) and potential data discrepancies deviates from the gold answer's straightforward interpretation of LP overhead impact.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-796-0", "category": "CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the ratios and identified the computational overhead, but their reasoning about the anomaly (ratio >1) and potential data discrepancies deviates from the gold answer's straightforward interpretation of LP overhead impact."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-796-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the ratios and identified the computational overhead, but their reasoning about the anomaly (ratio >1) and potential data discrepancies deviates from the gold answer's straightforward interpretation of LP overhead impact."}

This high $R^2$ value suggests that the model has strong explanatory power and that the included sources of variation (e.g., Vu, Vo, VVop Mix, etc.) are highly predictive of the outcome. The remaining 12% of the variance is unexplained and may be due to other factors not included in the model or random error.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that R² (coefficient of determination) measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage reduction. $\\text{Percentage reduction} = \\left(\\frac{0.31}{0.51}\\right) \\times 100 = 60.78\\%$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the run time per mission values from the table.\n- Problem 2: 0.51 seconds per mission\n- Problem 3: 0.20 seconds per mission\n\nStep 2: Calculate the absolute reduction:\n0.51 (Problem 2) - 0.20 (Problem 3) = 0.31 seconds\n\nStep 3: Compute the percentage reduction formula:\n(Reduction / Original) × 100 = (0.31 / 0.51) × 100\n\nStep 4: Perform the division:\n0.31 ÷ 0.51 ≈ 0.6078\n\nStep 5: Convert to percentage:\n0.6078 × 100 ≈ 60.78%\n\nFinal Answer: The percentage reduction in run time per mission when using the reduced arc set in Problem 3 is approximately 60.8%.\n\nQID: Management-table-140-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-140-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer matches the gold answer in both the calculation steps and the final result, providing a clear and accurate percentage reduction in run time per mission.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-140-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer matches the gold answer in both the calculation steps and the final result, providing a clear and accurate percentage reduction in run time per mission."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-140-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer matches the gold answer in both the calculation steps and the final result, providing a clear and accurate percentage reduction in run time per mission."}

Compare this with the reported total iterations of 836.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate continuous iterations. $3m = 3 \\times 619 = 1857$.\nStep 2: Calculate integer iterations (upper bound). $10m = 10 \\times 619 = 6190$.\nStep 3: Total estimated iterations = $1857 + 6190 = 8047$.\nStep 4: Compare with reported total (836).

How does this compare to the correlation between PageRank's quality index and Olson's rating, and what does this imply about the use of IF for journal rankings?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe Kendall's $\\tau$ of 0.1647 is much lower than the 0.5339 for PageRank's quality index, indicating a weak correlation between JCR IF and Olson's rating. The p-value of 0.20191, which is greater than 0.05, means this correlation is not statistically significant. In contrast, PageRank's quality index shows a significant and stronger correlation with Olson's rating. This implies that the Impact Factor (IF) is a less reliable metric for aligning with academicians' perceptions of journal quality compared to the PageRank quality index.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the PageRank-Olson correlation values from the table.\n- PageRank (β=0,β=0) vs Olson: τ=0.5017 (p=0.00010)\n- PageRank (β=1,β=1) vs Olson: τ=0.5339 (p=0.00003)\n\nStep 2: Compare with JCR IF-Olson correlation:\n- JCR IF vs Olson: τ=0.1647 (p=0.20191)\n\nStep 3: Analyze significance:\n- Both PageRank configurations show strong statistically significant correlations (p<0.001)\n- JCR IF correlation is weak and statistically insignificant (p=0.202)\n\nStep 4: Interpretation:\nThe substantially stronger correlation between PageRank's metric and Olson's expert rating suggests PageRank better aligns with human quality assessments.

What does this comparison reveal about the impact of long bottlenecks on pedestrian flow?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFor Figure 6 (first row), the flow ratio is $72:68$, so $Q1 = 72$ and $Q2 = 68$. Thus, $Q_{total} = Q1 + Q2 = 72 + 68 = 140$ pedestrians/min. For Figure 4 (first row), $Q = 72$ and $Q2 = 0$ (unidirectional flow), so $Q_{total} = 72$ pedestrians/min. The total flow in Figure 6 is higher, but the presence of a long bottleneck leads to more irregular time headways ($\\sigma_{i}/\\overline{{T}}_{i} = 1.001$) compared to Figure 4 ($\\sigma_{i}/\\overline{{T}}_{i} = 0.708$). This shows that long bottlenecks reduce the efficiency and regularity of pedestrian flow despite higher total flow.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant data from the table. For Figure 6 (first row), 'Q : Q2' shows 72:68 (Q1=72, Q2=68).\nStep 2: Calculate Q_total for Figure 6: 72 + 68 = 140 pedestrians/min.\nStep 3: For Figure 4 (first row), the scenario is unidirectional with 'Q : Q2' = 140:0. Here, the total flow is Q = 72 pedestrians/min (shown in the 'Q' column).\nStep 4: Compare totals: Figure 6’s bidirectional flow sums to 140 ped/min, while Figure 4’s unidirectional flow is 72 ped/min.\nStep 5: Contextual analysis: The text explains bottlenecks cause oscillations and reduced efficiency. Though Figure 6’s total flow appears higher, this reflects conflicting directional flows rather than smooth throughput. The effective capacity is reduced due to interruptions and variability in time headways (σ_i/T̄_i ≈ 1.001 for Figure 6 vs. 0.24 for non-bottleneck scenarios).\nStep 6: Conclusion: Long bottlenecks create unstable bidirectional flows where total pedestrian movement appears numerically similar or higher, but actual throughput efficiency is significantly reduced compared to unimpeded unidirectional flow.\n\nQID: Management-table-634-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-634-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly calculates the total flows for both figures, compares them accurately, and provides a detailed analysis of the impact of long bottlenecks on pedestrian flow efficiency, aligning with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-634-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly calculates the total flows for both figures, compares them accurately, and provides a detailed analysis of the impact of long bottlenecks on pedestrian flow efficiency, aligning with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-634-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly calculates the total flows for both figures, compares them accurately, and provides a detailed analysis of the impact of long bottlenecks on pedestrian flow efficiency, aligning with the gold answer."}

Step 2: The upper result (Tanner's model) is 8.57 sec. Step 3: The saturation condition is indicated by the value (a) in the table, which occurs when the waiting time becomes excessively high, indicating that the queue has saturated. Here, the modified Oliver and Bisbee formula shows a waiting time of 31.55 sec, which is significantly higher than Tanner's model, suggesting saturation at this flow rate.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that saturation occurs when the denominator of the modified Oliver and Bisbee formula (4) approaches zero, leading to indefinite queue growth.\n\nStep 2: From traffic flow theory, saturation condition typically relates to capacity being equal to demand. For formula (4), this would occur when the combined effect of major-road arrivals (q₁) and minor-road parameters reaches a critical threshold.\n\nStep 3: Using the heading context about τ (minimum intervehicle spacing) and β₂ (Tanner's parameter), analyze the structural relationship.

For L: $15/32 \\approx 0.47$, P: $8/18 \\approx 0.44$, M.W.: $11/25 = 0.44$, O: $14/20 = 0.70$. Step 2: The overall $C_s = 10.6/20.3 \\approx 0.52$. Step 3: Higher $C_s$ (e.g., O with 0.70) indicates greater service time variability, leading to longer queueing times.

Calculate the average number of subproblem pivots (SP) per efficient extreme point (EX) and discuss its significance in the context of computational overhead.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the average number of subproblem pivots (SP) per efficient extreme point (EX):\n1. Given EX = 21.00 and SP = 489.66.\n2. The average is $\\frac{SP}{EX} = \\frac{489.66}{21.00} \\approx 23.317$.\n3. This means approximately 23.317 subproblem pivots are required to generate one efficient extreme point.\n4. A high value indicates significant computational overhead, as many pivots are needed per solution. This aligns with the observation that larger problems (k=5) require more computational effort, even with tighter interval bounds (Xave=0.1).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant values from the table.\nFor k=5 and Xave=0.1 (Run 10):\n- EX (Efficient Extreme Points) = 21.00\n- SP (Subproblem Pivots) = 489.66\n\nStep 2: Calculate SP/EX ratio:\nSP per EX = 489.66 ÷ 21.00 ≈ 23.32\n\nStep 3: Interpret significance:\nThis ratio (23.32 pivots per extreme point) indicates computational effort required to generate each efficient solution. A higher ratio implies greater algorithmic complexity in resolving conflicts between objectives during pivot operations. With k=5 objectives requiring multi-criteria optimization, this reflects the trade-off between solution quality (capturing diverse efficient points) and computational resources needed to handle the increased combinatorial complexity of higher-dimensional weight spaces.\n\nQID: Management-table-815-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-815-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the average number of subproblem pivots per efficient extreme point (23.32) and provided a thorough interpretation of its significance in terms of computational overhead and algorithmic complexity.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-815-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the average number of subproblem pivots per efficient extreme point (23.32) and provided a thorough interpretation of its significance in terms of computational overhead and algorithmic complexity."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-815-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the average number of subproblem pivots per efficient extreme point (23.32) and provided a thorough interpretation of its significance in terms of computational overhead and algorithmic complexity."}

The problem restricts analysis to two-player PYS mechanisms with concave allocation functions. PYS mechanisms typically use proportional allocation rules where players receive resources proportional to their bids, modified by a shaping function (here, concave).\n\nStep 2: Define LPoA formulation. For two players, LPoA measures the worst-case ratio of optimal welfare to equilibrium welfare: LPoA = max_{(v₁, v₂)} [OPT(v₁, v₂) / Welfare_at_equilibrium(v₁, v₂)].\n\nStep 3: Leverage concavity constraints.

However, in transportation systems, $Q$ and $V$ are often inversely related (e.g., higher flow $Q$ reduces speed $V$ via congestion). This relationship causes $V$ to decrease as $Q$ increases.\n\nStep 3: The combination of $\\alpha_2 < 0$ and $\\alpha_3 > 1$ creates conflicting pressures: \n- Negative $\\alpha_2$ pushes $Q$ to infinity to minimize costs\n- Positive $\\alpha_3$ would normally penalize high $V$, but decreasing $V$ (due to rising $Q$) actually reduces the $\\alpha_3 V^{\\beta_3}$ term\n\nStep 4: This forms a destabilizing feedback loop: \n1.

The average delay per unit is $\\frac{68}{2} = 34$ days.\n   - Total delayed revenue cost $= D \\times C_d \\times \\text{average delay} = 108 \\times 0.10 \\times 34 = 367.20$.\n\n3. **Operational Batch Cost**:\n   - Total batch cost $= N \\times C_b = 6 \\times 200 = 1200$.\n\n4. **Total Annual Cost**:\n   - Total cost $= \\text{Delayed revenue cost} + \\text{Batch cost} = 367.20 + 1200 = 1567.20$.\n\nThus, the total annual cost is $\\boxed{1567.20}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate annual demand\nAnnual demand = 9 units/month × 12 months = 108 units\n\nStep 2: Calculate number of batches per year\nNumber of batches = 365 days ÷ 68 days/batch ≈ 5.3676 batches\n\nStep 3: Calculate annual batch cost\nBatch cost = 5.3676 batches × $200/batch ≈ $1,073.53\n\nStep 4: Calculate average delay per unit\nAverage delay = 68 days cycle ÷ 2 = 34 days\n\nStep 5: Calculate total delayed revenue cost\nDelayed cost = 108 units × 34 days × $0.10/day = $367.20\n\nStep 6: Calculate total annual cost\nTotal cost = $1,073.53 + $367.20 = $1,440.73\n\nQID: Management-table-77-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-77-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the delayed revenue cost and average delay, but incorrectly calculated the number of batches per year by using calendar days instead of demand-based batching.

Ohm’s Law: $\\pi_w - \\pi_v = f_e(x_e)$ for all $e=(v,w) \\in E$.\n2. Kirchhoff’s Law: $\\Gamma\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{q}$.\n\nFor the parametric electrical flow $\\mathbf{x}(\\lambda)$, we have $\\Gamma\\mathbf{x}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\mathbf{q}$. Assuming $\\mathbf{x}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}(1)$, we substitute into Ohm’s Law:\n\n$$\n\\pi_w(\\lambda) - \\pi_v(\\lambda) = f_e(\\lambda x_e(1)).\n$$\n\nSince $f_e$ is homogeneous ($f_e(0)=0$) and piecewise linear, $f_e(\\lambda x_e(1)) = \\lambda f_e(x_e(1))$ for $\\lambda \\geq 0$. Thus:\n\n$$\n\\pi_w(\\lambda) - \\pi_v(\\lambda) = \\lambda f_e(x_e(1)).\n$$\n\nThis suggests that the vertex potentials must also scale linearly with $\\lambda$, i.e., $\\pmb{\\pi}(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\pmb{\\pi}(1)$. Therefore, the conditions are satisfied if the marginal cost functions $f_e$ are homogeneous and the potentials scale linearly with $\\lambda$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall from Corollary 1 that electrical flows must satisfy two conditions: (1) Γx = q (flow conservation) and (2) π_w - π_v = f_e(x_e) for all edges e=(v,w) (Ohm’s law via potentials).\n\nStep 2: For parametric flows x(λ) with demands λq, substitute the ansatz x(λ) = λx(1). Flow conservation holds automatically since Γ(λx(1)) = λΓx(1) = λq.\n\nStep 3: Apply Ohm’s law to x(λ): Potential differences must satisfy π_w(λ) - π_v(λ) = f_e(λx_e(1)). For consistency with x(1), where π_w(1) - π_v(1) = f_e(x_e(1)), scale potentials as π(λ) = λπ(1).\n\nStep 4: Substitute scaled potentials into Ohm’s law: λ(π_w(1) - π_v(1)) = f_e(λx_e(1)). Using π_w(1) - π_v(1) = f_e(x_e(1)), simplify to λf_e(x_e(1)) = f_e(λx_e(1)).\n\nStep 5: Recognize this requires f_e(λx) = λf_e(x) for all λ ≥ 0 and x ∈ ℝ. This is homogeneity of degree 1. Given f_e is already strictly increasing, continuous, and piecewise linear (with f_e(0) = 0), this forces all linear segments in f_e to pass through the origin (no intercepts).\n\nConclusion: The necessary and sufficient condition is that every marginal cost function f_e must be homogeneous of degree 1 (i.e., linear through the origin in all piecewise segments). This ensures flow scaling preserves Ohm’s law across all λ.\n\nQID: Management-table-468-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-468-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly derives the conditions under which the parametric electrical flow satisfies the given scaling property, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the homogeneity of the marginal cost functions.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-468-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly derives the conditions under which the parametric electrical flow satisfies the given scaling property, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the homogeneity of the marginal cost functions."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-468-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly derives the conditions under which the parametric electrical flow satisfies the given scaling property, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the homogeneity of the marginal cost functions."}

Assume $f(x) = [T_0(x), \\sqrt{2}T_1(x), \\sqrt{2}T_2(x)]$ where $T_j(x)$ are Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nGiven $\\bar{u}(x) = c \\cdot \\exp[f^{\\top}(x)\\bar{Z}f(x)]$, we can relate the moments to the matrix $\\bar{Z}$. For $p=2$, $f(x) = [1, \\sqrt{2}x, \\sqrt{2}(2x^2 - 1)]$. The moments $\\hat{y}_j$ are given by $\\hat{y}_j = \\int_{-1}^1 x^j \\bar{u}(x) dx$.

For large samples, the critical t-value for 95% confidence is approximately 1.96.\n2. Margin of error: $ME = 1.96 \\times SE(b_3) = 1.96 \\times 0.080 = 0.1568$.\n3.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-408-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nThe mean cross-elasticities for the traditional and reverse models are -2.1 and 0.50 respectively. Interpret these values in the context of the lower choice level (Equation 46 for traditional, Equation 48 for reverse). How do these elasticities influence the total vehicle kilometers of travel?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe cross-elasticities measure the responsiveness of demand for one mode (e.g., car travel) to changes in the attributes of another mode (e.g., transit). \n\nFor the traditional model (Equation 46), a cross-elasticity of -2.1 implies that a 1% improvement in transit attributes (e.g., reduced travel time) would decrease car travel demand by 2.1%. This negative elasticity suggests strong substitution between transit and car travel in the traditional model.\n\nFor the reverse model (Equation 48), a cross-elasticity of 0.50 implies that a 1% improvement in transit attributes would increase car travel demand by 0.5%. This positive elasticity indicates complementarity between transit and car travel in the reverse model.\n\nThese elasticities influence the total vehicle kilometers of travel by affecting the modal split. The traditional model's higher negative elasticity leads to a lower growth rate in vehicle kilometers (67%) compared to the reverse model's positive elasticity, which contributes to a higher growth rate (40%).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand Cross-Elasticity Context\nThe cross-elasticities (-2.1 for traditional model, 0.50 for reverse model) measure how demand for one mode responds to changes in another mode's attributes at the lower choice level (Equation 46 for traditional, Equation 48 for reverse). Negative values indicate inverse relationships, while positive values suggest complementary effects.\n\nStep 2: Interpret Traditional Model Elasticity (-2.1)\nThe strong negative cross-elasticity implies high sensitivity: a 1% improvement in competing modes' attributes (e.g., transit speed) would reduce car demand by 2.1%. However, the nested structure shows car demand remains dominant due to urban dispersion and road improvements, leading to increased car usage despite congestion.\n\nStep 3: Interpret Reverse Model Elasticity (0.50)\nThe positive elasticity suggests limited substitution effects. Improvements in competing modes weakly correlate with increased car demand (0.5% per 1% change), indicating less mode-shifting sensitivity. This aligns with findings that only trip length (not demand or usage frequency) drives VKT growth in this model.\n\nStep 4: Relate to Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT)\nThe traditional model's higher elasticity magnitude (-2.1 vs 0.50) enables greater responsiveness to network improvements, amplifying car usage for longer suburban trips (67% VKT growth). The reverse model's lower sensitivity results in smaller VKT increases (40%), driven primarily by trip length changes rather than mode shifts.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize Results\nTraditional model's elastic structure allows all determinants (demand, frequency, trip length) to compound VKT growth. Reverse model's limited elasticity restricts growth mechanisms to trip length alone, reflecting its structural differences in handling modal competition at the lower choice level.\n\nQID: Management-table-408-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-408-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately interprets the cross-elasticities and their impact on vehicle kilometers of travel, aligning with the gold answer.

How does this compare to the theoretical average degree for a directed square grid graph?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the average degree of each node for the 10-10 grid, we first note that the number of arcs is 416 and the number of nodes is 102. The average degree $\\langle k \\rangle$ is given by the formula: \n\n$\\langle k \\rangle = \\frac{\\text{Total number of arcs}}{\\text{Number of nodes}} = \\frac{416}{102} \\approx 4.078$ \n\nFor a directed square grid graph, the theoretical average degree can be derived by considering the connectivity pattern. In a directed grid, each inner node typically has 4 outgoing arcs (up, down, left, right), boundary nodes have fewer, and corner nodes have the least. The exact theoretical average degree depends on the grid's boundary conditions, but for large grids, it approaches 4. Thus, the calculated average degree of approximately 4.078 for the 10-10 grid is consistent with the theoretical expectation, considering the finite size and boundary effects.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate average degree using Table 1 data\nFor the 10-10 grid, Nodes = 102 and Arcs = 416. In directed graphs, average degree = (2 × Arcs) / Nodes.\nCalculation: (2 × 416) / 102 ≈ 832 / 102 ≈ 8.16\n\nStep 2: Compare to theoretical directed grid\nA standard directed square grid typically has nodes connected to adjacent neighbors (right/down). Theoretical average out-degree ≈ 2 (edges excluded), total degree ≈4. However:\n- Table's value includes extra nodes (source/sink) boosting arcs\n- Actual calculation shows ~8.16 vs. ~4 theoretical\nConclusion: Higher average degree in the tested grid due to expanded connectivity rules beyond basic theoretical models.\n\nQID: Management-table-534-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-534-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate incorrectly calculated the average degree by doubling the number of arcs, leading to an inflated value (~8.16).

Using the input parameters from Panel A, determine whether this shipment should be assigned to a common carrier.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Compare the total distance with the maximum allowed distance.\n$1500 > 1200$ miles.\n\nStep 2: Since the distance exceeds the maximum allowed, the shipment should be directly assigned to a common carrier.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Check maximum distance rule. The round trip distance is 1,500 miles (750 miles one-way). Since 750 miles < 1,200-mile threshold, this rule doesn't trigger common carrier assignment.\n\nStep 2: Calculate total working time. Driving time = 1,500/55 ≈ 27.27 hours. Assuming 2 unloading stops (0.5 hrs each), unloading time = 1 hour. Total working time = 27.27 + 1 = 28.27 hours.\n\nStep 3: Determine required days/layovers. With 14-hour daily limit: 28.27/14 ≈ 2.02 days → 3 days required. This requires 2 layovers (10-hour breaks after Days 1 & 2), which is within the 3-layover maximum.\n\nStep 4: Verify cost parameters (though not directly required). Using formula C = 200*3 + 2*1500 + 30*2 = $3,660. However, cost comparison to common carriers isn't provided.\n\nConclusion: Since distance threshold isn't exceeded and working time constraints allow completion within permitted layovers, the shipment should NOT be assigned to a common carrier.\n\nQID: Management-table-17-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-17-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly interprets the distance as one-way (750 miles) when the question specifies a round trip (1,500 miles).

This is known as problem AN1 from Garey and Johnson, which is NP-complete.\n2. **NP-Hardness**: Since AN1 is NP-complete, the minimization problem is NP-hard. This is because any instance of AN1 can be reduced to an instance of the minimization problem in polynomial time.\n3. **Fixed Dimension**: The problem remains NP-hard even when the number of variables is fixed (in this case, two variables $x$ and $y$).\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the computational complexity of minimizing the quartic polynomial over the given rectangle is NP-hard, as indicated by entry (a) in Table 1.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the problem type in Table 1. The task involves minimizing a quartic polynomial (degree-four) over integer lattice points in a rectangular region defined by linear inequalities. This corresponds to the category \"Arbitrary polynomial\" objective with \"Linear constraints, integer variables\" in Table 1.\n\nStep 2: Match to entry (a). Table 1 entry (a) explicitly states that optimizing degree-four polynomials over lattice points of convex polygons (like rectangles) under linear constraints is NP-hard.\n\nStep 3: Verify polynomial classification. The objective $(x^2 - a - b y)^2$ expands to a non-convex quartic polynomial (due to mixed terms between $x$ and $y$), confirming it falls under the \"Arbitrary polynomial\" category rather than \"Convex polynomial.\"\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.

For Waiter 1 (A), the table shows assignments during multiple intervals (e.g., 7:00-8:00, 8:00-9:00, etc.), but the constraint implies that only one of these assignments can have $\\alpha_{g s u} = 1$ and the rest must be 0. The table's notation '1 1 1' might indicate multiple assignments, but the constraint requires that only one interval is actually assigned per day. Therefore, the table must be interpreted such that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to a single continuous block of time, and the '1's represent sub-intervals within that block.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the constraint meaning. The formula ∑ₛα_{gsu}=1 means for each waiter group (g), staff member (u), and day (s), the sum of assignments across service intervals equals 1.\n\nStep 2: Apply the constraint to Waiter 1 (A). For Monday (specific day s), Waiter 1 (A) (specific u) must satisfy ∑_{service intervals} α_{g Monday Waiter1(A)} = 1.\n\nStep 3: Interpret the result. Since the sum equals 1 across all service intervals, this mathematically enforces that Waiter 1 (A) can only be assigned to exactly one service time interval on Monday to satisfy the constraint.\n\nConclusion: The constraint inherently restricts each staff member to single daily assignment, proving Waiter 1 (A) cannot have multiple Monday service intervals.\n\nQID: Management-table-58-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-58-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly interprets the constraint and applies it to show that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to only one service time interval on Monday.

Since $\\hat{E}$ is valid, $E-\\hat{E}$ contains at least one minimum $s$-$t$ cut. The core is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of these minimum cuts, as they are the extreme points of the feasible region defined by the dual linear program $\\mathrm{DLP}(c,A,\\operatorname*{max})$. Thus, $z$ must be a convex combination of these vectors to satisfy the core conditions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the core definition. An imputation z is in the core if it satisfies efficiency (∑z(e) = v(E)) and coalitional rationality (∑_{e∈S}z(e) ≥ v(S) ∀S⊆E).\n\nStep 2: Recognize that in max flow games, v(S) equals the minimum cut capacity in subgraph S. By max-flow min-cut theorem, this coincides with the game's characteristic function.\n\nStep 3: Note that dummy edges Ě don't affect max flow, implying min cuts only exist in E-Ě. Core imputations must have z(e) = 0 for e ∈ Ě.\n\nStep 4: Observe that characteristic vectors of min cuts are incidence vectors where edges in cut get 1. Any convex combination preserves:\n(1) Efficiency: Total weight equals min cut size\n(2) Coalitional rationality: Each S receives ≥ its min cut value\n\nStep 5: For (⇒): If z is a convex combination of min cut vectors, it satisfies all core constraints by linearity. Each min cut vector satisfies ∑_{e∈C}1 ≥ v(C) = |C| for its cut C, and combinations preserve inequalities.\n\nStep 6: For (⇐): Use LP duality. The core corresponds to dual optimal solutions of max flow LP. By duality theorem, these solutions are exactly convex combinations of extreme points - which correspond to min cut characteristic vectors.\n\nStep 7: Combine results. Since core imputations must be dual optimal solutions, and all dual optimal solutions are convex combinations of min cut vectors, the equivalence is proven.\n\nQID: Management-table-642-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-642-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer thoroughly addresses the proof by breaking it down into logical steps, correctly applying the definitions of the core, max-flow min-cut theorem, and LP duality.

The CPU time for M0 is 181.79 seconds, and for M3 it is 59.72 seconds. The efficiency gain is calculated as: $\\text{Efficiency Gain} = \\frac{181.79 - 59.72}{181.79} \\times 100 = 67.15\\%$. This gain is due to M3's use of both the weighted-sum network problem and the min-max network problem, which reduces the number of iterations needed by the special simplex method for network problems with side constraints, as shown in Table 3.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Locate relevant data for Problem Category C with K=5 in the table.\nFor K=5, Category C row shows:\n- Procedure M0 (Mo) Avg CPU time: 181.79 (units)\n- Procedure M3 Avg CPU time: 59.72 (units)\n- M3's % of M0: 32.85% (from % column under M3)\n\nStep 2: Calculate efficiency gain:\nEfficiency Gain = (M0 CPU Time) / (M3 CPU Time) = 100% / 32.85% ≈ 3.045\nThis means M3 is ~3.045x faster than M0.\n\nStep 3: Mathematical reasoning:\nThe efficiency gain stems from M3's algorithmic improvements. The formula context indicates CPU time is proportional to iterations of network simplex methods (Nₙ, Nₘ, Nₛ). M3 likely reduces iterations through:\n1. Specialized handling of network problems with side constraints (Nₛ)\n2. Optimization of weighting vector processing\n3.

This makes the series stationary in mean.\nStep 2: Handle seasonality by either:\n- Adding seasonal AR/MA terms at lag S (seasonal period) to create an implicit SARIMA structure within ARIMA(p,d,q), or\n- Using seasonal dummy variables as exogenous regressors if combining regression with ARIMA errors.\nStep 3: Identify optimal p (AR order) and q (MA order) using autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots of the differenced series.\nStep 4: Compare multiple (p,d,q) combinations using:\n1. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) - balances fit and complexity\n2. SBC (Schwarz Bayesian Criterion) - stronger penalty for complexity than AIC\n3.

The constraint $b - a \\geq \\text{minDiff} - \\text{CABDiff}$ is equivalent to $a \\leq b - (\\text{minDiff} - \\text{CABDiff})$. Using order encoding, this translates to $b_{b - (\\text{minDiff} - \\text{CABDiff})}^a$. For example, if $\\text{minDiff} = 7$, $\\text{CABDiff} = 2$, and $b = 10$, then $a \\leq 10 - (7 - 2) = 5$.

Therefore, for every valid i in a's domain, create the implication:\n   a_i → ¬b_{i + D - 1}\n   where D = minDiff - CABDiff\n\nStep 5: Final constraints are all such implications for i where i + D - 1 falls within b's valid range.

Use the properties of the block structure and the sequential search condition.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine if a set in block $k$ can be included without violating the no-overcovering restriction, we must ensure that the set does not contain any elements $x_{i}$ for $1\\leq i\\leq k-1$.

However, the solution structure shows non-uniqueness at t = 1/k (continuous bifurcation) and accumulation of points at t = 0, indicating the absence of a nonsingular time.\n\nStep 2: Map to the table. The second row in the table applies: 'SDP with LICQ, continuous data, and strict feasibility, without a nonsingular time.'\n\nStep 3: Classify points. Analyze solution behavior:\n- Regular points: Exist in open intervals (e.g., t ∈ (1/(2k−1), 1/2k)), where solutions are unique and smooth.\n- Nondifferentiable points: At t = 0, f(t) is not differentiable due to oscillatory behavior near t = 0.\n- Discontinuous isolated multiple points: At t = 1/(2k) and t = 1/(2k+1), solutions jump discontinuously between (t,−t,−1) and (−t,t,−1).\n- Continuous bifurcation points: At t = 1/k, solutions form a continuum {(α,−α,−1) | α ∈ [−t,t]}.\n- Irregular accumulation points: Accumulation of t = 1/k points at t = 0.\n\nConclusion: The applicable types under the second row are discontinuous isolated multiple points, regular points, nondifferentiable points, continuous bifurcation points, and irregular accumulation points.\n\nQID: Management-table-546-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-546-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately identifies the problem assumptions, correctly maps to the second row of the table, and provides a thorough classification of the points, matching the gold answer in both reasoning and conclusion.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-546-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer accurately identifies the problem assumptions, correctly maps to the second row of the table, and provides a thorough classification of the points, matching the gold answer in both reasoning and conclusion."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-546-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer accurately identifies the problem assumptions, correctly maps to the second row of the table, and provides a thorough classification of the points, matching the gold answer in both reasoning and conclusion."}

Step 2: This policy minimizes NSF charges by ensuring that smaller checks are processed first, reducing the likelihood of larger checks causing an overdraft. Step 3: Since the policy inherently minimizes NSF charges, increasing the overdraft protection does not affect the number of NSF charges because the sequencing order already optimizes for minimal charges. Thus, the average number of NSF charges remains constant regardless of the overdraft protection level.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the low-high sequencing policy processes checks from smallest to largest amount.

For links with flow in $V^{*}=(57,0,0,43,43,0)$, the non-zero flows are $V^{1}=57$, $V^{4}=43$, and $V^{5}=43$. The partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial c_{1}}{\\partial V^{1}}=\\frac{1}{10}$, $\\frac{\\partial c_{4}}{\\partial V^{4}}=\\frac{1}{24}$, and $\\frac{\\partial c_{5}}{\\partial V^{5}}=\\frac{1}{10}$. The Jacobian matrix shows non-zero entries only for these partial derivatives, confirming it is diagonal for links with flow.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall the equilibrium solution V* = (57,0,0,43,43,0). Non-zero flows exist on links 1, 4, and 5.\n\nStep 2: Examine the cost functions for each link. All cost functions c_i depend only on their own link volume V^i (e.g., c₁ = 31 + V¹/10). This makes every partial derivative ∂c_i/∂V_j = 0 when i ≠ j.\n\nStep 3: Compute the Jacobian matrix (∂c/∂V)*. Since cross-derivatives (i ≠ j) vanish, the matrix is diagonal. For example:\n- ∂c₁/∂V₁ = 1/10 (non-zero diagonal entry),\n- ∂c₄/∂V₄ = 1/24,\n- ∂c₅/∂V₅ = 1/10.\n\nStep 4: Confirm all off-diagonal terms are zero for links with flow (1,4,5).

The third cumulant, which relates to skewness, is additive. Given the skewness values for Business 1 ($\\gamma_1 = 0.5$) and Business 2 ($\\gamma_2 = 0.8$), the portfolio's total skewness $\\gamma_p$ is calculated as follows:\n\n1.

Let $a_i$ represent the attribute vector for the $i^{th}$ die, where $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.\n2. Let $w_i$ be the weight associated with the $i^{th}$ die, representing its contribution to the assembly's attributes.\n3.

However, specific disparities (e.g., Queens East $P_i = 20.8$ vs. Richmond $D_j = 4.0$) suggest localized inefficiencies.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract P_i (plow-mile %) and D_j (plow distribution %) values from Table 4.\nP = [8.6, 6.5, 6.6, 9.9, 9.6, 7.5, 6.8, 14.7, 20.8, 9.2]\nD = [9.2, 10.7, 8.9, 8.4, 11.0, 11.5, 9.8, 12.8, 13.5, 4.0]\n\nStep 2: Compute sum of absolute differences ∑∑|P_i - D_j|:\nFor each P_i, calculate |P_i - D_j| across all D_j and sum.

This suggests moderate resource allocation efficiency. However, contextual analysis shows Manhattan's dense population naturally required more plows for refuse collection, while areas like Queens East and Richmond show mismatches between allocated plow-miles and actual plow distribution.\n\nQID: Management-table-698-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-698-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's calculation of the Gini coefficient (0.193) significantly differs from the gold answer (0.0426), indicating a computational error.

[7] for a graph with $n=1000$, $m=5000$, and $W=10$. Use the formula context to justify your answer.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Gabow's algorithm has a running time of $O(n(m + n \\log n))$. Substituting $n=1000$ and $m=5000$, we get $O(1000(5000 + 1000 \\log 1000)) \\approx O(5 \\times 10^6 + 1000 \\times 3000) \\approx O(3 \\times 10^6)$. Step 2: Cygan et al.'s algorithm has a running time of $O(W n^\\omega)$, where $\\omega \\approx 2.3728$. For $W=10$ and $n=1000$, this is $O(10 \\times 1000^{2.3728}) \\approx O(10 \\times 10^{7.12}) \\approx O(10^{8.12})$.

The decomposition formula shows that the problem can be broken down into $W$ subproblems, but the algebraic approach of Cygan et al. is less efficient for small $W$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the asymptotic running times from the table:\n- Gabow[17]: O(n(m + n log n))\n- Cygan et al. [7]: O(Wn^ω) (where ω ≈ 2.373 is the matrix multiplication exponent)\n\nStep 2: Substitute n=1000, m=5000, W=10:\nFor Gabow:\n1000*(5000 + 1000 log 1000) ≈ 1000*(5000 + 1000*10) = 15,000,000 operations\nFor Cygan:\n10*(1000)^2.373 ≈ 10*13,100,000 = 131,000,000 operations\n\nStep 3: Compare results:\nGabow's algorithm requires ~15 million operations vs. Cygan's ~131 million under these parameters.

How does this impact the overall goal programming objective function $Z = \\sum_{i=1}^4 P_i (d_i^+ + d_i^-)$?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify that cost minimization (P4) was not achieved in any quarter, implying $d_i^- > 0$ for all $i=1,2,3,4$.\nStep 2: Since P4 is the lowest priority, its deviations are only minimized after higher-priority goals (P1-P3) are satisfied.\nStep 3: The total deviation for cost minimization is $\\sum_{i=1}^4 d_i^-$. This term appears in the objective function as $P4 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^4 d_i^-$.\nStep 4: The overall objective function $Z$ prioritizes P1-P3 first, so the cost deviations are only minimized subject to higher-priority constraints.

However, since P4 is the lowest priority, this term only affects Z after higher-priority goals (P1-P3) have been addressed first.\n\nConclusion: The total cost deviation sum adds a P4-weighted term to Z, but its influence is subordinate to higher-priority goals in the optimization hierarchy.\n\nQID: Management-table-123-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-123-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the steps and reasoning provided in the gold answer, including the prioritization of goals and the calculation of total deviation for cost minimization.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-123-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the steps and reasoning provided in the gold answer, including the prioritization of goals and the calculation of total deviation for cost minimization."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-123-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the steps and reasoning provided in the gold answer, including the prioritization of goals and the calculation of total deviation for cost minimization."}

For the 'Education' station, the CDC guideline is 30 minutes and the measured time is 22.117 minutes. The deviation is $\\left( \\frac{22.117 - 30}{30} \\right) \\times 100 = -26.28\\%$. For the 'Vaccination' station, the CDC guideline range is 0.5 to 2 minutes, and the measured time is 3.6 minutes.

Which scenarios are Pareto optimal?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine Pareto efficiency, we compare scenarios where no other scenario has both fewer buses and a higher survey score. Step 1: List the (B, S) pairs: Current (650, 48), NewRoutes (530, 48), LowCost (450, 37), MaxSurvey (934, 56), Optimal (481, 40). Step 2: Identify dominated scenarios: LowCost is dominated by Optimal (481 < 450 is false, but 40 > 37, so no dominance). NewRoutes dominates Current (530 < 650 and 48 ≥ 48). MaxSurvey is not dominated (highest S). Step 3: Pareto frontier includes NewRoutes, MaxSurvey, and Optimal, as no other scenarios simultaneously reduce B and increase S.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify B (Buses) and S (Survey Score) values for each scenario:\n- Current: B=650, S=48%\n- NewRoutes: B=530, S=48%\n- LowCost: B=450, S=37%\n- MaxSurvey: B=934, S=56%\n- Optimal: B=481, S=40%\n\nStep 2: Apply Pareto efficiency criteria (no other scenario improves one metric without worsening the other):\n1. MaxSurvey (B=934, S=56%) is Pareto optimal because it has the highest survey score (no scenario can improve S without increasing B further).\n2. NewRoutes (B=530, S=48%) is Pareto optimal because no scenario reduces B below 530 while maintaining ≥48% S.\n3. Optimal (B=481, S=40%) is Pareto optimal because no scenario achieves S >40% with B ≤481.\n4.

Case 3 achieves minimal WT but requires 3 units of each resource, while Case 7 uses fewer resources (e.g., 6 investigators instead of 9) but maintains reasonable WT (18%) and throughput time (88 days).

Step 1: For LowCost to Optimal, $\\% \\Delta E = \\frac{6 - 43}{43} = -0.8605$ (86.05% decrease), $\\% \\Delta S = \\frac{40 - 37}{37} = 0.0811$ (8.11% increase).

The negative value indicates that reducing early starts slightly improves satisfaction, but the low magnitude suggests community preferences are relatively inelastic to changes in early high school start times.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant data points from the table:\n- LowCost scenario: E = 43%, S = 37%\n- Optimal scenario: E = 6%, S = 40%\n- Current scenario: E = 74%, S = 48% (baseline)\n\nStep 2: Calculate percentage changes using Current as baseline:\nFor LowCost:\n%ΔE = (43-74)/74 = -41.89%\n%ΔS = (37-48)/48 = -22.92%\nElasticity = (-22.92%)/(-41.89%) ≈ 0.55\n\nFor Optimal:\n%ΔE = (6-74)/74 = -91.89%\n%ΔS = (40-48)/48 = -16.67%\nElasticity = (-16.67%)/(-91.89%) ≈ 0.18\n\nStep 3: Interpret results:\n- LowCost's elasticity (0.55) shows survey scores are relatively sensitive to early starts - each 1% reduction in E reduces S by ~0.55%.\n- Optimal's lower elasticity (0.18) indicates survey scores are less affected by E changes, suggesting better community trade-offs between schedule changes and satisfaction.\n\nConclusion: The community prefers the combination of factors in Optimal scenario where dramatic E reductions (-91%) only mildly impact satisfaction (-16.7%), indicating successful balancing of priorities through multi-objective optimization.\n\nQID: Management-table-393-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-393-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate used the Current scenario as a baseline, which was not specified in the question.

This implies for every scenario ω ∈ Ω, there exists a symmetric counterpart -ω ∈ Ω with equal probability under μ.\n\nStep 2: Observe that when second-stage variables are continuous, the two-stage problem becomes convex. This allows splitting first-stage decisions and combining second-stage responses.\n\nStep 3: Let x_Rob be an optimal robust solution. Construct a stochastic solution x_Stoch = ½x_Rob. For any realization ω, use the second-stage variables to handle both ω and -ω symmetrically. By convexity, this remains feasible.\n\nStep 4: Compute expected cost: E[cost(x_Stoch,ω)] = ½E[cost(x_Rob,ω) + cost(x_Rob,-ω)]. Symmetry implies these paired terms equal z_Rob(b), making E[cost] ≤ ½z_Rob(b). Thus z_Stoch(b) ≥ ½z_Rob(b).\n\nStep 5: Therefore, z_Rob(b)/z_Stoch(b) ≤ 2.

Provide a step-by-step explanation using the LP formulations and dual solutions.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe CEC policy rejects a class $j$ request while the BPC policy accepts it when $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq R_{j} < \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t)$. This occurs in the scenario where $y_{j}^{*} < \\min(D_{j}^{t-1},1)$ in all optimal solutions of $\\mathrm{LP}(\\mathbf{n}, \\mathbf{D}^{t-1})$. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From Proposition 3, we have $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq \\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n}-\\mathbf{A}^{j},t)$.\n2. If $y_{j}^{*} < \\min(D_{j}^{t-1},1)$ in all optimal solutions, complementary slackness implies $u_{j}^{\\mathbf{n},t} = 0$ and $(\\mathbf{v}^{\\mathbf{n},t})^{\\prime} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}^{j} = R_{j}$.\n3. Under the assumption that the dual basis changes, Proposition 3 gives $\\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t) > \\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) = R_{j}$.\n4. Thus, $R_{j} < \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t)$, so CEC rejects the request.\n5. However, BPC accepts the request because $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) = R_{j} \\leq R_{j}$.\n\nThis aligns with the third column of Table 1, where CEC rejects and BPC accepts.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the inequalities. The BPC policy uses bid prices BP_j(n,t), while CEC uses OC_j^LP(n,t). The inequalities BP_j(n,t) ≤ OC_j^LP(n,t) ≤ BP_j(n−A^j,t) imply OC lies between two bid prices.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Table 1. The middle column (y* < min(D_j,1) in all y*, but ≠ 0 in some) corresponds to CEC rejecting and BPC accepting. This scenario occurs when R_j falls strictly between BP_j(n,t) and OC_j^LP(n,t).\n\nStep 3: Relate to LP/duals. LP(n,D^{t−1}) = R'y*, and OC_j^LP = LP(n) − LP(n−A^j). When y* < min(D_j,1) in all optimal solutions (but >0 in some), OC_j^LP(n,t) > R_j due to tight capacity constraints, forcing CEC to reject. However, BP_j(n,t) = v^{n,t}⋅A^j ≤ R_j holds, allowing BPC to accept.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. CEC rejects when OC_j^LP > R_j, while BPC accepts when BP_j(n,t) ≤ R_j. This occurs precisely when BP_j(n,t) ≤ R_j < OC_j^LP(n,t), corresponding to y* < min(D_j,1) in all optimal solutions (but not identically zero).\n\nQID: Management-table-619-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-619-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the condition (BP_j(n,t) ≤ R_j < OC_j^LP(n,t)) and provides a step-by-step explanation that aligns with the gold answer, including the role of y* in optimal solutions and the implications for CEC and BPC policies.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-619-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the condition (BP_j(n,t) ≤ R_j < OC_j^LP(n,t)) and provides a step-by-step explanation that aligns with the gold answer, including the role of y* in optimal solutions and the implications for CEC and BPC policies."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-619-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the condition (BP_j(n,t) ≤ R_j < OC_j^LP(n,t)) and provides a step-by-step explanation that aligns with the gold answer, including the role of y* in optimal solutions and the implications for CEC and BPC policies."}

The SH-SR mechanism's LPoA upper bound of φ=1.618 is established in Theorem 8.\n\nStep 2: To prove it's tight, we must demonstrate there exists a game instance where the equilibrium efficiency ratio equals φ.

At equilibrium, players bid proportional to their valuations divided by payment parameters (from E2-SR). Calculations show the equilibrium allocation splits resources in a φ:1 ratio.\n\nStep 4: Optimal welfare would allocate all resources to player 1 (valuation 1), but equilibrium welfare becomes (φ/(1+φ))·1 + (1/(1+φ))·(φ-1) = (φ²)/(1+φ) ≈ 1.

How does this likelihood influence the updated belief weight $w_i'$ if the prior weight $w_i$ is 0.3 and the sum of weighted likelihoods $\\sum_{j=1}^n w_j \\cdot L_j$ is 0.5?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the likelihood $L_i$ for the model predicting 50% Native Grass-Forb cover, we use the binomial probability formula: $L_i = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$, where $n = 6,700$ (total stops), $k = 3,538$ (observed Native Grass-Forb stops), and $p = 0.5$ (predicted probability). However, for large $n$, we approximate using the normal distribution. The mean $\\mu = n \\cdot p = 3,350$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p) = 1,675$. The z-score is $z = \\frac{3,538 - 3,350}{\\sqrt{1,675}} \\approx 4.59$. The likelihood $L_i$ is then the probability density at this z-score, which is very small. The updated belief weight is $w_i' = \\frac{0.3 \\cdot L_i}{0.5} \\approx 0$, indicating the model is highly unlikely given the data.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key values from the table and problem statement. The observed frequency for Native Grass-Forb in MN is 52.81% (3,538 successes out of 6,700 total stops). The model predicts 50% cover (p=0.5).\n\nStep 2: Compute the binomial likelihood \\( L_i \\). For n=6,700 trials and k=3,538 successes, \\( L_i = \binom{6700}{3538} (0.5)^{3538}(0.5)^{3162} = (0.5)^{6700} \\). The binomial coefficient \\(\binom{6700}{3538}\\) cancels out during belief weight normalization.\n\nStep 3: Simplify \\( L_i = (0.5)^{6700} \\), an extremely small value (~0).\n\nStep 4: Calculate updated belief weight \\( w_i' \\) using \\( w_i' = \\frac{w_i \\cdot L_i}{\\sum w_j \\cdot L_j} \\). Substitute \\( w_i = 0.3 \\), \\( L_i \\approx 0 \\), and \\( \\sum w_j \\cdot L_j = 0.5 \\). This gives \\( w_i' \\approx \\frac{0.3 \\cdot 0}{0.5} = 0 \\).\n\nConclusion: The negligible likelihood \\( L_i \\) drastically reduces the updated belief weight \\( w_i' \\) to near zero, indicating poor model performance compared to alternatives.\n\nQID: Management-table-349-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-349-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculates the binomial likelihood and updates the belief weight, arriving at the same conclusion as the gold answer.

Use the data to derive this probability and discuss its implications for facility planning.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected admission is an out-of-catchment patient admitted to the General Hospital (GH), we use the counts from Table 1. The number of out-of-catchment admissions to GH is 106, and the total admissions are 884. The probability $P$ is calculated as:\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{106}{884} \\approx 0.1199 \\text{ or } 11.99\\%\n$$\n\nThis implies that approximately 12% of all admissions are out-of-catchment patients at GH. For facility planning, this highlights the importance of considering external demand when allocating resources, as a significant portion of GH's capacity is utilized by non-local patients.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant data from the table. The 'Out of Catchment, insured' column for General Hospital shows 106 admissions. The TOTAL admissions across all facilities is 884.\n\nStep 2: Calculate probability as favorable cases/total cases. Probability = 106/884 ≈ 0.1199 (11.99%).\n\nStep 3: Implications for planning: ~12% of admissions are out-of-catchment patients at General Hospital, indicating it serves a wider region.

Provide a step-by-step mathematical explanation.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine when an employee $i$ is assigned to a shift $j$ in block $k$ but has not yet met the minimum shift requirement, we analyze the variables step-by-step:\n\n1. The variable $a_{ijk}$ is defined as:\n   $$a_{ijk} = 1 \\text{ if } T_{ik} = 0 \\text{ and } X_{ijk} = 1$$\n   Here, $T_{ik} = 0$ implies that $O_{ik} < 1$ (i.e., the employee has not exceeded the min shift requirement), and $X_{ijk} = 1$ means the employee is assigned to shift $j$ in block $k$.\n\n2. The variable $b_{i'jk}$ is defined as:\n   $$b_{i'jk} = 1 \\text{ if } a_{ijk} = 1 \\text{ and } \\theta_{ik} = 0$$\n   Here, $\\theta_{ik} = 0$ implies that the employee has not met the min shift requirement ($S_{ik} < R_{ik}$).\n\n3. Combining these, the condition for $b_{i'jk} = 1$ is:\n   - $T_{ik} = 0$ (employee has not exceeded the min shift requirement),\n   - $X_{ijk} = 1$ (employee is assigned to shift $j$ in block $k$),\n   - $\\theta_{ik} = 0$ (employee has not met the min shift requirement).\n\n4. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   $$b_{i'jk} = 1 \\text{ when } (R_{ik} - S_{ik} < 1) \\text{ and } (X_{ijk} = 1) \\text{ and } (S_{ik} < R_{ik})$$\n\nThus, the condition is satisfied when the employee is assigned to the shift but has not yet met the minimum shift requirement.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall that θ_ik = 1 indicates employee i has met/exceeded their minimum shift requirement in block k. Therefore, θ_ik = 0 means they have NOT met it.\nStep 2: Variable a_ijk is defined as 1 when Tik = 0 and Xijk = 1. Since Tik = 0 implies Oik < 1 (requirement met), a_ijk = 1 represents assignments AFTER meeting requirements.\nStep 3: The condition we want (assigned but not met) is Xijk = 1 with θik = 0. This corresponds to a_ijk = 0 (since requirement not met implies Tik = 1) AND Xijk = 1.\nStep 4: Mathematically, the condition is expressed as: Xijk = 1 ∧ a_ijk = 0. This ensures assignment (Xijk = 1) and unmet requirement (Tik = 1 ⇨ a_ijk = 0).\nStep 5: Though b_i'jk is defined using a_ijk and θik, it cannot capture this condition directly due to a conflict in definitions (b_i'jk requires a_ijk = 1 and θik = 0, which is impossible simultaneously). The valid derivation uses only a_ijk and assignment status.\n\nQID: Management-table-253-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-253-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's reasoning incorrectly interprets the conditions for a_ijk and b_i'jk, leading to a flawed conclusion.

Consider the constraint that each run must use the same needle assignments for each logo part across all heads.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate total capacity per run. The 12-head machine and 4-head machine give $C = 12 + 4 = 16$ heads.\nStep 2: The order has $G = 16$ garments, which exactly matches the capacity $C = 16$.

Let $y$ be the average number of LSQR iterations and $x = \\log_{10}(\\tau)$. From the table, for $\\tau \\in [10^{-4}, 10^{-11}]$, the data points are approximately $(x, y) = (-4, 16.4), (-5, 21.8), \\dots, (-11, 14.9)$. The regression model can be written as $y = a \\cdot \\log_{10}(\\tau) + b$. Using least squares estimation, we solve for $a$ and $b$ by minimizing the sum of squared errors. The resulting model can be used to predict the average number of iterations for any $\\tau$ in the specified range.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract relevant data from Table 8 for τ ∈ [10⁻⁴, 10⁻¹¹].

Plotting log₁₀(τ) vs iterations shows a near-linear relationship.\n\nStep 3: Perform linear regression on log-transformed τ values (x = log₁₀(τ)) vs iterations (y).

This shows $V^{PL} \\leq V^{LR}$.\n\n2. **Equality**: The separation problem for (PL) can be formulated as a linear program (SepLR) using Lagrange multipliers. Proposition 3 shows that $\\Phi_t(\\bar{\\mathcal{V}}) = \\Pi_t(\\bar{\\mathcal{V}})$, implying the optimal values of (PL) and (LR) coincide. The Lagrangian multipliers $\\lambda_{i,j,t}$ in (LR) coordinate the acceptance decisions across resources, ensuring the same upper bound is achieved.\n\nThus, $V^{PL} = V^{LR}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the mathematical formulations of both methods. The PL approach constructs a linear program with constraints that enforce piecewise-linear upper bounds on the value function. The LR approach introduces Lagrange multipliers to relax capacity constraints and decompose the problem into single-resource subproblems.\n\nStep 2: Observe that both methods aim to compute upper bounds through linear programming. The PL constraints correspond to keeping the value function convex and manageable through linear segments, while LR achieves this through penalty terms in the objective function.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that the Lagrangian multipliers (λ_{i,j,t}) in LR correspond to dual variables of the PL constraints. The Lagrangian dual problem in LR maximizes over λ while maintaining ∑λ = f_j, which aligns with the PL constraint structure.\n\nStep 4: Apply strong duality from linear programming theory. Since both formulations describe the same feasible region for the value function approximation and use equivalent objective functions (maximization of revenue upper bounds), their optimal solutions V^{PL} and V^{LR} must coincide.\n\nStep 5: Verify through Proposition 2 that the dual space of PL's LP matches the feasible Lagrangian multiplier space in LR.

The cost matches since $\\bar{d}$ maximizes $d(\\omega)^T y^*(\\bar{\\omega})$. \\n5. Thus $z_{\\mathrm{Rob}} \\leq z_{\\mathrm{Adapt}}$, and equality holds by definition.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand hypercube uncertainty sets. A hypercube uncertainty set allows each uncertain parameter to vary independently within interval bounds, characterized by J(Ω) = {ξ : ||ξ||_∞ ≤ 1}. This structure means worst-case scenarios occur at vertices (extreme points) of the cube.\n\nStep 2: Define z_Rob(b,d) and z_Adapt(b,d). The robust solution z_Rob(b,d) optimizes decisions before uncertainty is revealed, ensuring feasibility for all ξ ∈ J(Ω). The adaptive solution z_Adapt(b,d) selects some decisions after observing ξ.\n\nStep 3: Analyze constraint coefficient uncertainty. For linear constraints of the form A(ξ)x + B(ξ)y ≤ d, hypercube uncertainty implies each coefficient in A(ξ), B(ξ) varies independently within known bounds.\n\nStep 4: Vertex property of hypercubes. Since adaptive solutions can optimize y after ξ is revealed, but the worst-case performance occurs at a vertex of the hypercube. Robust solutions must also account for all vertices.\n\nStep 5: Equivalence at vertices. For every vertex ξ^v, the robust solution must satisfy constraints at ξ^v, while the adaptive solution can optimize y for ξ^v. However, since the hypercube’s independence ensures no conflict between constraints at different vertices, the worst-case objective value for both formulations coincides.\n\nStep 6: Conclude adaptability gap = 1.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-637-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nFor the 150-point problem with demand parameters [0.7-0.9], calculate the total demand if the average number of vehicles saved is 25.80 and the vehicle capacity is 160 units.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The minimal number of vehicles is given by $\\text{Total Demand} / \\text{Vehicle Capacity}$. Step 2: The average number of vehicles saved is the difference between the VRP vehicles and the minimal number of vehicles. Step 3: Let $D$ be the total demand. Then, $25.80 = \\text{VRP vehicles} - D / 160$. Step 4: Assuming the VRP uses the ceiling of $D / 160$, we approximate $\\text{VRP vehicles} = \\lceil D / 160 \\rceil$. Step 5: For large $D$, $\\lceil D / 160 \\rceil \\approx D / 160 + 0.5$. Step 6: Substituting, $25.80 \\approx (D / 160 + 0.5) - D / 160 = 0.5$, which is inconsistent. Therefore, the exact calculation requires knowing the VRP vehicles. Alternatively, if the minimal vehicles are $D / 160$, then $25.80 = \\text{VRP vehicles} - D / 160$. Without loss of generality, if $\\text{VRP vehicles} = \\lceil D / 160 \\rceil = D / 160 + \\theta$, where $0 \\leq \\theta < 1$, then $25.80 = \\theta$. Thus, $D = 160 \\times (\\text{VRP vehicles} - 25.80)$. For example, if $\\text{VRP vehicles} = 26$, then $D = 160 \\times (26 - 25.80) = 32$ units, which is unrealistic. This suggests that the exact calculation requires additional information about the VRP vehicles used.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that 'average number of vehicles saved' (25.80) represents the difference between VRP vehicles and SDVRP vehicles.\nStep 2: Since demand parameters [0.7-0.9] mean each customer requires full vehicle capacity (112-144 units), VRP requires 1 vehicle per customer (150 total).\nStep 3: Set up equation: 150 (VRP vehicles) - (Total Demand/160) = 25.80 vehicles saved\nStep 4: Solve for Total Demand:\n150 - (D/160) = 25.80 → D/160 = 124.2 → D = 124.2 × 160\nStep 5: Calculate result: 124.2 × 160 = 19,872 units\nFinal Answer: Total demand = 19,872 units\n\nQID: Management-table-637-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-637-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's calculation incorrectly assumes the VRP vehicles are 150, which is not supported by the problem context.

Optimality conditions require:\na) Flow conservation constraints from Table 1:\n$$\n\\sum_{(i,j)\\in A}x_{i j}^{s} - \\sum_{(j,i)\\in A}x_{j i}^{s} = e_{i}^{s}\\quad\\forall i\\in N,s\\in S\n$$\nb) Binary path selection where x_ij^s = 1 only for arcs on the shortest path for shipment s\n\nStep 3: The leader's problem with α = 0 simplifies to:\n$$\n\\operatorname*{min}_{y}\\ \\sum_{s\\in S}\\sum_{(i,j)\\in A}n^{s}\\rho_{i j}^{h(s)}x_{i j}^{s}\n$$\nsubject to design constraints x_ij^s ≤ y_ij^{h(s)}.

Justify using the concept of best responses.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nIn the bad market, the payoff matrix shows (5,1) when 1 sets high and 2 sets low. To find the Nash equilibrium, we check best responses: \\n1. If 2 sets low, 1's best response is high (5 > 3). \\n2. If 1 sets high, 2's best response is low (1 > -infinity, since no other option is given). \\nThus, (high, low) is a Nash equilibrium with payoff $5$ for competitor 1.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Reconstruct the payoff matrix from the HTML table. Competitor 1's strategies are 'low' and 'high', and Competitor 2's strategies are 'low' and 'high'. The payoffs are:\n- (low, low): (3, 3)\n- (low, high): (2, 4)\n- (high, low): (5, 1)\n- (high, high): (1, 5).\n\nStep 2: Verify if (high, low) is a Nash equilibrium. For a Nash equilibrium, neither player should benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nStep 3: Check Competitor 1's best response to Competitor 2 choosing 'low'. If 2 chooses 'low', 1's payoff for 'low' is 3 and for 'high' is 5. Thus, 1's best response is 'high'.\n\nStep 4: Check Competitor 2's best response to Competitor 1 choosing 'high'. If 1 chooses 'high', 2's payoff for 'low' is 1 and for 'high' is 5. Thus, 2's best response is 'high', not 'low'.\n\nStep 5: Since Competitor 2 would deviate from 'low' to 'high' when 1 plays 'high', (high, low) is NOT a Nash equilibrium. Therefore, there is no Nash equilibrium payoff for Competitor 1 in this scenario.\n\nNote: The cell (5, 1)* might suggest an equilibrium marker, but standard best-response analysis confirms no Nash equilibrium exists in this strategy profile.\n\nQID: Management-table-802-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-802-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate incorrectly concludes that (high, low) is not a Nash equilibrium.

For 'Four or more', we assume 5 articles.\\n\\nFor MS-Theory: $(1 \\times 29.2) + (2 \\times 16.5) + (3 \\times 8.8) + (5 \\times 3.6) = 29.2 + 33.0 + 26.4 + 18.0 = 106.6 / 100 = 1.066$ articles.\\n\\nFor MS-Appln.: $(1 \\times 24.2) + (2 \\times 26.2) + (3 \\times 23.1) + (5 \\times 12.1) = 24.2 + 52.4 + 69.3 + 60.5 = 206.4 / 100 = 2.064$ articles.\\n\\nFor Interfaces: $(1 \\times 13.5) + (2 \\times 20.4) + (3 \\times 16.3) + (5 \\times 28.6) = 13.5 + 40.8 + 48.9 + 143.0 = 246.2 / 100 = 2.462$ articles.\\n\\nInterpretation: Interfaces has the highest weighted average (2.462), indicating more articles are read per respondent, followed by MS-Appln. (2.064) and MS-Theory (1.066). This suggests Interfaces is more engaging or relevant to readers.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant categories - Use 'One', 'Two', 'Three', and 'Four or more' columns with midpoint 5 for calculations. Treat 'Keep for Reference Only' and 'News Only' as 0 articles. Exclude 'N.R.'

Use the concept of cross-elasticity and the reported parameters.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: A 10% wage increase raises the opportunity cost of travel time. Step 2: The positive correlation (0.6761) implies that higher-wage individuals may prefer car driver-metro for faster travel, despite higher costs. Step 3: Cross-elasticity can be approximated as $\\epsilon = (\\Delta Q / Q) / (\\Delta w / w)$, where $Q$ is mode choice probability. Step 4: Assuming a linear relationship, a 10% wage increase could increase car driver-metro usage by approximately 6.761% (0.6761 * 10%), reflecting time sensitivity among higher earners.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key parameters. The correlation coefficient between Work (PWork) and car driver-metro mode is 0.6761, indicating a strong positive relationship. The wage rate ($w$) is given as $4.45 in the table.\n\nStep 2: Apply cross-elasticity concept. A 10% wage increase raises the opportunity cost of time. Since the value of time saved (3.07–3.49 USD/hour) is close to the wage rate, workers will prioritize time-efficient modes. The positive correlation implies car driver-metro mode is already associated with work-related travel.\n\nStep 3: Economic interpretation. Higher wages incentivize workers to adopt time-saving modes (like car driver-metro) to allocate more time to productive work. The 0.6761 correlation suggests this mode is elastic to wage changes – a 10% wage increase would amplify its preference proportionally, reinforcing the observed work-mode relationship.\n\nStep 4: Implications. Policymakers should anticipate increased demand for car driver-metro infrastructure as wages rise, while employers might see improved productivity from reduced travel time burdens.\n\nQID: Management-table-415-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-415-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly interprets the economic implications of a wage increase using the concept of cross-elasticity and the reported parameters.

How does the SA fleet's diversification strategy impact capacity distribution compared to EP?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate EP fleet capacity. For A1: $1 \\times 100 = 100$; A3: $5 \\times 155 = 775$; B1: $6 \\times 85 = 510$; C1: $2 \\times 122 = 244$. Total EP capacity = $100 + 775 + 510 + 244 = 1,629$. Step 2: Calculate SA fleet capacity. For A1: $2 \\times 100 = 200$; A2: $2 \\times 130 = 260$; A3: $1 \\times 155 = 155$; A4: $2 \\times 175 = 350$; B1: $4 \\times 85 = 340$; B2: $1 \\times 70 = 70$; C1: $1 \\times 122 = 122$. Total SA capacity = $200 + 260 + 155 + 350 + 340 + 70 + 122 = 1,497$. Step 3: The SA fleet reduces reliance on high-capacity A3 and B1 types, distributing capacity more evenly across aircraft types, which aligns with scenario-based optimization.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate EP Fleet Capacity\n- A1: 1 aircraft × 100 = 100\n- A3: 5 aircraft × 155 = 775\n- B1: 6 aircraft × 85 = 510\n- C1: 2 aircraft × 122 = 244\n- C2: 1 aircraft × 145 = 145\nTotal EP Capacity = 100 + 775 + 510 + 244 + 145 = 1,774\n\nStep 2: Calculate SA Fleet Capacity\n- A1: 2 aircraft × 100 = 200\n- A2: 2 aircraft × 130 = 260\n- A3: 1 aircraft × 155 = 155\n- A4: 2 aircraft × 175 = 350\n- B1: 4 aircraft × 85 = 340\n- B2: 1 aircraft × 70 = 70\n- C1: 1 aircraft × 122 = 122\n- C3: 1 aircraft × 110 = 110\nTotal SA Capacity = 200 + 260 + 155 + 350 + 340 + 70 + 122 + 110 = 1,607\n\nStep 3: Analyze Diversification Impact\nSA uses 8 aircraft types (A1–A4, B1–B2, C1, C3) compared to EP’s 5 types (A1, A3, B1, C1, C2). While SA’s total capacity is 9.4% lower than EP’s, its diversified fleet spreads capacity across more aircraft types, reducing reliance on specific models (e.g., no C2 usage, limited A3/B1 dependence).

From the localized error-density field (Figure 8b), $P_{\\theta|\\mathrm{Forecast}}(\\theta)$ likely shows higher density for $\\theta$ values close to 0.5, increasing the numerator in $$\\bar{\\theta}=\\frac{\\int_{0}^{0.5}P_{\\theta}(\\theta)*\\theta d\\theta}{\\mathrm{CDF}(0.5)}.$$ \n\nStep 2: Calculate $\\widehat{\\overline{\\sigma}}^{\\mathrm{Modified}}$ using $\\bar{\\theta}$.

This occurs when the term $k_1\\cos n\\theta_h$ vanishes, i.e., when $k_1 = 0$. In this case, the density simplifies to $D_{h}(r_{h},\\theta_{h})=K\\exp\\{-k_{0}{r_{h}}^{2}\\}$, which is radially symmetric. Thus, circular symmetry is achieved when $k_1 = 0$, and the parameter $k_0$ controls the radial decay of the density.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand circular symmetry requires angular independence. For the density model Dₕ(rₕ,θₕ) = K exp{-[k₀ + k₁cos(nθₕ)]rₕ²} to be circularly symmetric, it must depend only on radial distance rₕ, not on angle θₕ.\n\nStep 2: Identify angular dependence. The term containing θₕ is k₁cos(nθₕ) in the exponent. For circular symmetry, this angular dependence must vanish.\n\nStep 3: Derive condition. The cos(nθₕ) term can only be eliminated if its coefficient k₁ = 0. This removes all angular dependence:\nDₕ(rₕ) = K exp{-k₀rₕ²}\n\nStep 4: Relate parameters.

This constraint ensures that the solution does not exceed a specified bound $q$, which can be useful in practical applications where resources are limited. To solve $\\tilde{P}(M,l,h,q)$, we first solve the primal problem $P(M,l,h)$ without the additional constraint.

The maximum service time for an established patient is 12 minutes. The probability that a new patient's service time exceeds 12 minutes is the probability that a value from $U(30, 40)$ is greater than 12. Since the entire range of $U(30, 40)$ is above 12, the probability is 1 (or 100%).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the service time distributions from the table.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-289-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nConsidering the pseudo-Boolean engines listed in Table 3 (MINISATP, GLUCOSE, HSAT, LINGELIN, TREENGELIN), if each engine has a different runtime distribution, how would you model the expected runtime when running them in parallel? Assume the runtime of each engine follows an exponential distribution with rate parameters $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\lambda_4, \\lambda_5$ respectively.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nWhen running the engines in parallel, the system stops as soon as the first engine completes. The runtime of the parallel system is therefore the minimum of the individual runtimes. If each engine's runtime follows an exponential distribution with rate parameters $\\lambda_i$, the runtime of the parallel system is also exponentially distributed with a rate parameter equal to the sum of the individual rates: $\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\lambda_i$. The expected runtime of the parallel system is then $E[T] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\lambda_i}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that when running multiple solvers in parallel, the effective runtime is governed by the first solver to complete. This corresponds to the minimum of multiple independent exponential random variables.\n\nStep 2: For exponential distributions, the minimum of k independent variables with rates λ₁, λ₂,...,λ₅ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter equal to the sum of individual rates: λ_total = λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃ + λ₄ + λ₅.\n\nStep 3: The expected value of an exponential distribution with rate λ is 1/λ. Therefore, the expected runtime when running all 5 engines in parallel would be E[T] = 1/(λ₁ + λ₂ + λ₃ + λ₄ + λ₅).\n\nThis models the situation where we expect the parallel system to finish as soon as the fastest engine completes its computation.\n\nQID: Management-table-289-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-289-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the minimum of exponential distributions and accurately calculates the expected runtime as the reciprocal of the sum of the individual rates, matching the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-289-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the minimum of exponential distributions and accurately calculates the expected runtime as the reciprocal of the sum of the individual rates, matching the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-289-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the minimum of exponential distributions and accurately calculates the expected runtime as the reciprocal of the sum of the individual rates, matching the gold answer."}

Use the parameters $q_1$, $q_2$, $r$, $p$, and $n$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the probability that a driver reported as wearing a seat belt was actually wearing one, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let $A$ be the event that the driver was actually wearing a seat belt, and $R$ be the event that the driver was reported as wearing one. We need to compute $P(A|R)$. \n\nFor severe injuries: \n$P(R|A) = q_1$, $P(A) = r p^n$, $P(R|\\neg A) = 0$, $P(\\neg A) = (1-r)p$. \nThus, $P(R) = P(R|A)P(A) + P(R|\\neg A)P(\\neg A) = q_1 r p^n$. \nSo, $P(A|R) = \\frac{P(R|A)P(A)}{P(R)} = \\frac{q_1 r p^n}{q_1 r p^n} = 1$ for severe injuries.\n\nFor slight injuries: \n$P(R|A) = q_2$, $P(A) = r(1-p^n)$, $P(R|\\neg A) = 0$, $P(\\neg A) = (1-r)(1-p)$. \nThus, $P(R) = q_2 r(1-p^n)$. \nSo, $P(A|R) = \\frac{q_2 r(1-p^n)}{q_2 r(1-p^n)} = 1$ for slight injuries.\n\nCombining both cases, the probability is always 1, as non-wearers are never reported as wearing a seat belt.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant reporting probabilities from the table. For severe injuries, actual seat belt wearers are reported as wearing with probability q1, and for slight injuries, with probability q2. Non-wearers are never reported as wearing (probability 0).\nStep 2: Compute the proportion of severely and slightly injured drivers. Wearers have pⁿ severe injuries and (1−pⁿ) slight injuries. Non-wearers have p severe and (1−p) slight injuries.\nStep 3: Calculate the total probability of being reported as wearing a seat belt. This includes only actual wearers: P(Reported Wearing) = r[q1pⁿ + q2(1−pⁿ)].\nStep 4: Since non-wearers contribute 0 to reported wearing, the probability that a reported wearer is an actual wearer is the ratio of actual wearers reported correctly to all reported wearers.\nThus, Probability = [r(q1pⁿ + q2(1−pⁿ))] / [r(q1pⁿ + q2(1−pⁿ))] = 1. However, considering possible interpretation nuances, the intended formula accounting for parameters is: [r(q1pⁿ + q2(1−pⁿ))] divided by the same expression (yielding 1).\n\nQID: Management-table-647-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-647-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly applies Bayes' Theorem and arrives at the same conclusion as the gold answer, showing that the probability is 1 for both severe and slight injuries.

Use the data to derive a mathematical relationship between $\\epsilon$ and the constraint violation.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Observe the constraint violation (Violation (M)) for $\\epsilon = 0.04$ at run time 0.03125s: $1.22 \\times 10^2$. For $\\epsilon = 0.01$ at the same run time: $2.52 \\times 10^1$. The violation decreases as $\\epsilon$ decreases.\n\nStep 2: At run time 0.125s, the violations for all $\\epsilon$ values converge to machine precision ($\\sim 10^{-15}$), indicating that smaller $\\epsilon$ requires more iterations but achieves higher accuracy.\n\nStep 3: The relationship can be modeled as $V(\\epsilon) \\approx k_1 \\epsilon^{k_2}$, where $V$ is the violation. Using the data points, we estimate $k_2 \\approx 1$ (linear relationship for larger $\\epsilon$).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Observe the data patterns in the table. For fixed run times (e.g., 0.03125, 0.0625 seconds), constraint violations decrease as ε decreases from 0.04 to 0.01. For example:\n- At 0.0625s runtime: violation drops from 17.5 (ε=0.04) → 2.85 (ε=0.02) → 0.868 (ε=0.01).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the rate of change. When ε is halved:\n- From ε=0.04 to 0.02: violation reduces by ~6x (17.5 → 2.85)\n- From ε=0.02 to 0.01: violation reduces by ~3.3x (2.85 → 0.868)\n\nStep 3: Test proportionality hypotheses. Violation values align better with a quadratic relationship (violation ∝ ε²) than linear. Verification:\n- For ε=0.04: 0.04² = 0.0016 → 17.5/0.0016 ≈ 10,937 proportionality constant\n- For ε=0.02: 0.02² = 0.0004 → 2.85/0.0004 ≈ 7,125 proportionality constant\n- For ε=0.01: 0.01² = 0.0001 → 0.868/0.0001 ≈ 8,680 proportionality constant\n\nStep 4: Derive the mathematical relationship. Average proportionality constants (~8,900) suggest:\nviolation ≈ 8900ε²\n\nConclusion: Constraint violation decreases quadratically as ε decreases, with the relationship approximated by violation ∝ ε².\n\nQID: Management-table-589-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-589-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the trend of decreasing violation with decreasing ε but proposes a quadratic relationship (violation ∝ ε²) based on their analysis, whereas the gold answer suggests a linear relationship (V(ε) ≈ k₁ε) for larger ε.

For the problem instances with $N=3$ and $\\tau=25$, we observe the following:\n1. For $\\alpha=1.0$, $V^{PL}=972$.\n2. For $\\alpha=1.2$, $V^{PL}=868$.\n3. For $\\alpha=1.6$, $V^{PL}=700$.\n\nAs $\\alpha$ increases, the total expected demand relative to capacity increases, leading to higher congestion and thus lower optimal expected revenue. This is because higher demand tightness (higher $\\alpha$) implies more competition for limited resources, reducing the firm's ability to optimally allocate capacity and maximize revenue.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand α's definition as tightness ratio: α = (ΣΣΣp_j,t)/(Σr_i^1), where numerator represents total potential revenue opportunities and denominator represents total initial capacity.\n\nStep 2: Examine table data for (25,3,α) instances:\n- At α=1.0: V^PL = 972\n- At α=1.2: V^PL = 868\n- At α=1.6: V^PL = 700\n\nStep 3: Observe inverse relationship: Higher α corresponds to lower V^PL. This suggests tighter capacities (higher demand pressure relative to capacity) reduce achievable revenue.\n\nStep 4: Reasoning: Higher α implies either:\n1) Increased demand intensity (more requests) or \n2) Reduced capacities. Both scenarios force earlier capacity exhaustion, limiting ability to hold seats for high-revenue opportunities.\n\nStep 5: Validate pattern: The trend holds across all instance groups in the table (e.g., (25,2) and (50,3) show similar α-V^PL inverse relationships).\n\nConclusion: As tightness ratio α increases, optimal expected revenue V^PL decreases due to reduced capacity availability relative to demand, limiting revenue optimization opportunities despite more constrained operations.\n\nQID: Management-table-565-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-565-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the inverse relationship between α and V^PL, provides detailed reasoning about capacity constraints and demand pressure, and aligns with the gold answer's conclusions.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-565-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the inverse relationship between α and V^PL, provides detailed reasoning about capacity constraints and demand pressure, and aligns with the gold answer's conclusions."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-565-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the inverse relationship between α and V^PL, provides detailed reasoning about capacity constraints and demand pressure, and aligns with the gold answer's conclusions."}

What does this tell us about the system's rollout consistency?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the average operational duration per depot, first sum the operational months for all listed depots (excluding the total 142 months): $25 + 22 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 9 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 139$ months. There are 11 depots, so the average is $\\frac{139}{11} \\approx 12.64$ months. Next, compute the standard deviation: First, find the squared differences from the mean for each depot, sum them, divide by the number of depots, and take the square root. For example, for Wharton: $(25 - 12.64)^2 = 152.77$. Repeat for all depots, sum the squared differences ($\\approx 584.55$), divide by 11 ($\\approx 53.14$), and take the square root ($\\approx 7.29$). The high standard deviation relative to the mean indicates significant variability in rollout durations, suggesting inconsistent implementation timelines across depots.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract operational months data (excluding empty entries and total row):\n[25, 22, 12, 15, 14, 13, 12, 9, 6, 6, 5]\n\nStep 2: Calculate average:\nTotal = 25 + 22 + 12 + 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 9 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 139\nAverage = 139 ÷ 11 ≈ 12.64 months\n\nStep 3: Compute standard deviation:\n1.

Use the formula $\\sum_{r\\ni f}d_{r f}X_{r}=D_{f}$ to explain how delays might propagate differently under each policy.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFor Fleet 1, ARO has a higher OT+15 (69.25%) compared to SCC (68.44%), indicating better on-time performance. However, ARO has fewer cancellations (4.77%) than SCC (8.41%), but slightly less passenger inconvenience (31.55% vs. 33.44%). The formula $\\sum_{r\\ni f}d_{r f}X_{r}=D_{f}$ shows that delays propagate as a sum over all routes containing leg $f$.

Assuming no precedence constraints, $R(S) = \\{3\\}$ (the last task in any sequence). We then compute $f(S)$ as follows: 1. For $i = 3$, $S \\setminus \\{3\\} = \\{1, 2\\}$.

The WIP ($L$) is proportional to NPIP, so $L_2 = k \\cdot 7$, where $k$ is a constant. Thus, $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{L_2}{W_2} = \\frac{7k}{130}$. Step 2: For Case 4, NPIP = 5 and $W_4 = 99$ days.

Assume $d_n(a_n) = 2$ and $v_n(a_n) = 1$ for all customers.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo compute the expected total cost for 3 customers, we evaluate $g(x,a)$ step-by-step for each customer and sum the results. For one customer, the cost components are:\n1. Revenue: $r_n(d_n) = 5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n2. Transportation cost: $-c_n v_n = -2 \\times 1 = -2$.\n3. Holding cost: $-h_n(x_n + d_n) = -1 \\times (x_n + 2)$. Assume $x_n = 0$ initially, so this term is $-2$.\n4. Penalty cost: $-E^{F_n}[p_n(\\max\\{U_n - (x_n + d_n), 0\\})]$. Since $U_n$ is uniform over $1$ to $10$, $\\max\\{U_n - 2, 0\\}$ is $0$ for $U_n \\leq 2$ and $U_n - 2$ otherwise. The expected penalty is $3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{u=3}^{10} (u - 2) = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} \\times 36 = 10.8$.

The expected total cost is $-14.4$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify components of the cost function for each customer. Given parameters: r_n(d_n) = 5*2 = 10, c_n*v_n = 2*1 = 2, h_n(x_n + d_n) = 1*(x_n + 2).

Assume each group's influence on issue selection is represented by a weight $w_i$, and each issue's importance within a group is scored $s_{ij}$. Derive an aggregate prioritization score $P_j$ for each issue $j$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo model issue prioritization quantitatively, we can use a weighted sum approach:\n\n1. Let $w_i$ be the weight of participant group $i$ (e.g., Administrators, Politicians), where $\\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i = 1$.\n2. Let $s_{ij}$ be the importance score of issue $j$ for group $i$, normalized to $[0,1]$.\n3. The aggregate prioritization score for issue $j$ is:\n   $$P_j = \\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i s_{ij}$$\n\nExample calculation:\n- Suppose weights: Administrators ($w_1=0.3$), Politicians ($w_2=0.25$), Researchers ($w_3=0.2$), Citizens ($w_4=0.25$).\n- For issue 'Finances':\n  - $s_{1,\\text{Finances}}=0.9$ (Administrators),\n  - $s_{2,\\text{Finances}}=0.7$ (Politicians),\n  - $s_{3,\\text{Finances}}=0.4$ (Researchers),\n  - $s_{4,\\text{Finances}}=0.8$ (Citizens).\n- Then:\n  $$P_{\\text{Finances}} = 0.3\\times0.9 + 0.25\\times0.7 + 0.2\\times0.4 + 0.25\\times0.8 = 0.725$$\n\nThis framework allows systematic comparison of issue prioritization across stakeholder groups.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify constituent groups (Administrators, Politicians, Researchers, Citizens) and their respective weights w_i based on influence. These weights could sum to 1 (normalized) or remain absolute values depending on context.\\n\\nStep 2: For each issue j (e.g., Inflation, Taxes, Housing), collect its importance scores s_ij from each group's perspective using the table's listed priorities. For example, Inflation would get scores from Politicians (s_Politician,j) and Citizens (s_Citizen,j).\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate aggregate prioritization score P_j using weighted summation: \\nP_j = Σ(w_i × s_ij) for all groups i where the issue j appears.\\n\\nStep 4: Normalize scores (optional) if required for comparability across issues. The resultant P_j values allow ranking issues by aggregating both cross-group influence (via w_i) and intra-group priority (via s_ij).\\n\\nExample: If Administrators (w=0.3) score Zoning as s=90, Politicians (w=0.4) score it s=20, Researchers (w=0.2) ignore it, and Citizens (w=0.1) score it s=50: P_Zoning = (0.3×90)+(0.4×20)+(0.1×50) = 27 + 8 + 5 = 40.\n\nQID: Management-table-72-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-72-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly outlines the steps for calculating the aggregate prioritization score using a weighted sum approach, matching the gold answer's methodology.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-683-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nHow do partial conservation laws (PCLs) ensure the indexability of a restless bandit project?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nPartial conservation laws (PCLs) ensure indexability by providing a framework where work and cost measures decompose linearly in terms of state-action frequencies. For a project to be PCL-indexable, it must satisfy Assumptions 4.1 and 4.2, which include positive marginal workloads $w_{i}^{S}>0$ and a nondecreasing MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$. The PCLs guarantee that the $\\nu$-wage problem's solution is characterized by $\\mathcal{F}$-policies, and the MPI can be computed as $\\nu_{i}^{*}=c_{i}^{S}/w_{i}^{S}$. This structure ensures that the project obeys diminishing marginal returns, making it $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the role of Partial Conservation Laws (PCLs)\nPCLs generalize conservation laws by relaxing strict flow balance constraints while maintaining structured feasible regions. They define F-extended polymatroids, which are convex sets characterizing achievable work-cost performance measures in restless bandits (RBs).\n\nStep 2: Link F-extended polymatroids to indexability\nIn F-extended polymatroids, the work-cost trade-off frontier exhibits diminishing returns. This guarantees the existence of a unique marginal productivity index (MPI) ν_i* = -Δf^{S_i}/Δg^{S_i} at each state i, quantifying the reward-cost ratio of activating the bandit in that state.\n\nStep 3: Establish monotonicity through PCLs\nPCLs ensure that the achievable work-cost pairs form directional convex sets. This creates a monotonic relationship where states can be ordered by their MPIs, making the active action set S_i shrink monotonically as the MPI threshold increases.\n\nStep 4: Validate indexability\nBy satisfying PCLs, the restless bandit project becomes F-indexable: (1) the passive action (e.g., making to stock) becomes optimal in states below the MPI threshold, and (2) the active action (e.g., making to order) becomes optimal above it. This state-space partitioning aligns with the MPI ranking, ensuring indexability.\n\nStep 5: Enable MPI computation\nThe PCL-induced F-extended polymatroid structure allows recursive MPI calculation through adaptive greedy algorithms, similar to Gittins index computation in classical bandits but extended to restless systems through work measure adaptations.\n\nQID: Management-table-683-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-683-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains how PCLs ensure indexability by detailing the role of F-extended polymatroids, MPI computation, and state-space partitioning, aligning well with the gold answer's emphasis on structural guarantees and diminishing returns.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-683-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains how PCLs ensure indexability by detailing the role of F-extended polymatroids, MPI computation, and state-space partitioning, aligning well with the gold answer's emphasis on structural guarantees and diminishing returns."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-683-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains how PCLs ensure indexability by detailing the role of F-extended polymatroids, MPI computation, and state-space partitioning, aligning well with the gold answer's emphasis on structural guarantees and diminishing returns."}

Use the formula for spill rate $SR = \\frac{\\text{Total Spilled}}{\\text{Total Passengers}}$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the total passengers (boarded + spilled) from the table. \nTotal Passengers = 109 (boarded) + 66 (spilled) = 175.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the actual spill rate.\n$SR_{\\text{actual}} = \\frac{66}{175} \\approx 0.3771$ or 37.71%.\n\nStep 3: The overbooking level is 138, and the aircraft capacity is 150. The expected number of passengers that can be accommodated without spilling is 150, but the airline overbooks to 138, implying they expect some no-shows. \n\nHowever, the spill rate depends on the no-show rate and the overbooking level. Without the no-show rate, we cannot calculate the expected spill rate directly. But if we assume a no-show rate $p$, the expected number of passengers showing up is $138 \\times (1 - p)$. The expected spill is $\\max(0, 138 \\times (1 - p) - 150)$. \n\nGiven the actual spill is 66, we can estimate $p$ by solving $138 \\times (1 - p) - 150 = 66$, which gives $1 - p = \\frac{216}{138} \\approx 1.5652$, which is not possible as $p$ would be negative. This suggests that the overbooking level of 138 is too low to explain the actual spill of 66, indicating either an error in the overbooking level or an unusually high show rate.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate Actual Spill Rate using the formula SR = Total Spilled / Total Passengers.\nFrom the table, Total Spilled = 66 and Total Passengers = 175.\nActual SR = 66 / 175 ≈ 0.3771 ≈ 37.71%.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Expected Spill Rate.\nOverbooking level is 138 (bookings allowed), aircraft capacity is 150. Since 138 < 150, there should theoretically be no spills as all booked passengers can be accommodated.\nExpected Spilled Passengers = max(138 - 150, 0) = 0.\nThus, Expected SR = 0 / 138 = 0%.\n\nStep 3: Compare Actual vs Expected.\nActual spill rate (37.71%) is significantly higher than expected spill rate (0%). This indicates either operational constraints not reflected in capacity numbers or model discrepancies between booked passengers and actual demand shown in the table (175 total passengers vs 138 overbooking limit).\n\nQID: Management-table-84-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-84-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the actual spill rate and identified the discrepancy between the expected and actual spill rates, noting the operational or model issues that could explain the difference.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-84-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the actual spill rate and identified the discrepancy between the expected and actual spill rates, noting the operational or model issues that could explain the difference."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-84-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate correctly calculated the actual spill rate and identified the discrepancy between the expected and actual spill rates, noting the operational or model issues that could explain the difference."}

The number of efficient extreme points is influenced by the diversity of gradients $d^{j}$.\n2. For k=4, the weights $\\lambda_{j,i}$ must satisfy $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\lambda_{j,i}=1$ and $\\lambda_{j,i}>0$.\n3. The interval bounds $0.4<\\lambda_{4}<0.5$ restrict the possible combinations of weights.\n4. To maximize the number of efficient extreme points, the gradients $d^{j}$ should be as distinct as possible.\n5. This occurs when the weights $\\lambda_{j,i}$ are at the extreme points of their feasible region, i.e., at the bounds of the intervals.\n6. Thus, the condition is to choose weights at the vertices of the feasible weight space defined by the interval bounds.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that the number of efficient extreme points in a multi-objective LP depends on the diversity of gradient directions formed by the weighted sum \\(d^j = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_{j,i}c^i\\).\n\nStep 2: For k=4 and \\(\\lambda_{\\text{ave}} = 0.25\\), the interval bounds require \\(0.4 < \\lambda_4 < 0.5\\), leaving \\(0.5 < \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\lambda_i < 0.6\\) to maintain \\(\\sum \\lambda_i = 1\\).\n\nStep 3: To maximize distinct gradient directions (and thus efficient points), the remaining weights (\\(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3\\)) must span their maximum feasible intervals. This occurs when:\n- \\(\\lambda_1\\), \\(\\lambda_2\\), and \\(\\lambda_3\\) are distributed to cover the full residual weight (\\(0.5 < \\sum \\lambda_i < 0.6\\)) with minimal overlap in their contributions.\n\nStep 4: The condition is achieved when all non-\\(\\lambda_4\\) weights reach their extremal values simultaneously while maintaining \\(0.4 < \\lambda_4 < 0.5\\), creating maximal angular variation between the \\(d^j\\) vectors.

Show the step-by-step calculation.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo verify the average daily queueing cost for truck user type P, we follow these steps: 1. Convert the average queueing time from minutes to hours: $9 \\text{ min} = \\frac{9}{60} \\text{ h} = 0.15 \\text{ h}$. 2. Multiply by the unit queueing cost: $0.15 \\text{ h} \\times 6.0 \\text{ m.u./h} = 0.9 \\text{ m.u. per request}$. 3. Multiply by the average demand rate per hour: $0.9 \\text{ m.u. per request} \\times 3.0 \\text{ requests/h} = 2.7 \\text{ m.u./h}$. 4. Multiply by 24 hours to get the daily cost: $2.7 \\text{ m.u./h} \\times 24 \\text{ h} = 64.8 \\text{ m.u./day}$. However, the table shows $40.5 \\text{ m.u./day}$, indicating a possible adjustment factor or different calculation method.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the values for truck user type P from the table. Average queueing time = 9 minutes, Unit queueing cost = 6.0 m.u./h, Average demand rate = 3.0 per hour.\nStep 2: Convert queueing time to hours: 9 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.15 hours.\nStep 3: Apply the formula: C_day = (0.15 h) × (6.0 m.u./h) × (3.0/h) × 24 hours/day.\nStep 4: Calculate intermediate values: 0.15 × 6.0 = 0.9 m.u./request, 0.9 × 3.0 = 2.7 m.u./hour.\nStep 5: Multiply by 24 hours: 2.7 × 24 = 64.8 m.u./day.\nConclusion: The calculated value (64.8 m.u./day) does not match the table's value (40.5 m.u./day).

At every step, the algorithm maintains an almost complementary BFS where all variable pairs (v_i, w_i) satisfy v_iw_i = 0 except for exactly one pair involving z.\n\nStep 3: Observe that in such a BFS, either z is basic (non-zero) and its complementary variable is non-basic (zero), or vice versa. This ensures the product of the non-complementary pair equals zero.\n\nStep 4: Since all other pairs are strictly complementary (v_iw_i = 0), summing over all components gives ⟨v, w⟩ = Σv_iw_i = 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0.\n\nStep 5: During pivoting, the algorithm swaps variables while preserving the almost complementary property. The new non-complementary pair after pivoting will still have one variable at zero (non-basic), maintaining ⟨v, w⟩ = 0.\n\nConclusion: Maintaining an almost complementary BFS ensures exactly one non-complementary pair with zero product at all times, preserving ⟨v, w⟩ = 0 throughout the algorithm.\n\nQID: Management-table-440-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-440-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly follows the reasoning of the gold answer, detailing how maintaining an almost complementary BFS ensures ⟨v, w⟩ = 0 throughout the algorithm, with clear steps mirroring the gold's logic.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-440-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly follows the reasoning of the gold answer, detailing how maintaining an almost complementary BFS ensures ⟨v, w⟩ = 0 throughout the algorithm, with clear steps mirroring the gold's logic."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-440-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly follows the reasoning of the gold answer, detailing how maintaining an almost complementary BFS ensures ⟨v, w⟩ = 0 throughout the algorithm, with clear steps mirroring the gold's logic."}

From the formula, it's the product of $f_t(t)$ from $t=1$ to $T$.\n\n2. **Penetration Calculation**: Penetration is $b_{\\iota}=1-P_{\\iota}(0)$. This represents the fraction of the population that purchases brand $\\iota$ at least once.\n\n3. **Relation to Negative Binomial**: The negative binomial model estimates penetration as $b_{\\iota}=1-(1+m/k)^{-k}$. By setting $k=\\theta_{\\iota}(1-\\rho)/\\rho$ and taking $T \\to \\infty$, the Polya-Eggenberger distribution converges to the negative binomial, making the two penetration estimates asymptotically equivalent.\n\nThus, both models provide consistent estimates of penetration under large $T$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall the Polya-Eggenberger distribution is derived from a Beta-binomial process where purchase probability θ follows a Beta distribution. Penetration b_ι is defined as 1 minus the probability of zero purchases (P_ι(0)).\n\nStep 2: For the Beta-binomial model, P_ι(0) = E[(1-θ)^T] where θ ~ Beta(α,β). This expectation equals B(α,β+T)/B(α,β) using Beta function properties.\n\nStep 3: Using Gamma function relationships, B(α,β+T)/B(α,β) = Γ(α+β)Γ(β+T)/[Γ(β)Γ(α+β+T)]. This gives penetration b_ι = 1 - Γ(α+β)Γ(β+T)/[Γ(β)Γ(α+β+T)].\n\nStep 4: For the negative binomial model (NBD), penetration is derived from the Gamma-Poisson mixture. Using the parameter relationship k_ι = θ_ι(1-ρ)/ρ from the formula context, we recognize this connects Beta parameters (α = k_ι, β = θ_ι(1-ρ)/ρ) to NBD parameters.\n\nStep 5: As the number of trials T → ∞, the Polya-Eggenberger distribution converges to NBD. This means the Beta-binomial penetration formula reduces to the NBD penetration formula 1 - (1+μ/k_ι)^{-k_ι} through limit analysis of the Gamma functions, demonstrating their equivalence in the infinite horizon limit.\n\nQID: Management-table-761-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-761-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly derives the penetration using the Polya-Eggenberger distribution and explains its relation to the negative binomial model.

How would the service areas change if a new camp is added in UMMMOOPMOS SA?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo solve this, we first calculate the pairwise Euclidean distances between each province and the camps. For a province $P$ at coordinates $(x_p, y_p)$ and a camp $C_i$ at $(x_i, y_i)$, the distance is $d(P, C_i) = \\sqrt{(x_p - x_i)^2 + (y_p - y_i)^2}$. The Voronoi cell for $C_i$ includes all provinces where $d(P, C_i) \\leq d(P, C_j)$ for all other camps $C_j$. \n\n1. **Initial Service Areas**: For the initial camps (Cordoba, Logronio, Salamanca, SEGSOSAZ ZA), we compute the distances and assign each province to the nearest camp. \n2. **Adding a New Camp**: When a new camp is added in UMMMOOPMOS SA, we recompute the distances. Provinces previously assigned to other camps may now be closer to UMMMOOPMOS SA, shrinking the service areas of the original camps. \n3. **Example Calculation**: Suppose Cordoba is at (0, 0), Logronio at (3, 0), Salamanca at (0, 4), and SEGSOSAZ ZA at (3, 4). A province at (1, 1) has distances $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ to Cordoba, $\\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ to Logronio, etc. It is assigned to Cordoba. If UMMMOOPMOS SA is added at (1.5, 1.5), the distance becomes $\\sqrt{(1-1.5)^2 + (1-1.5)^2} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$, which is less than $\\sqrt{2}$, so the province is reassigned to UMMMOOPMOS SA.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify initial camps and their Voronoi cells. The original camps are Cordoba, Logronio, Salamanca, and SEGSOSAZ ZA. Their Voronoi cells are determined by Euclidean distance, where provinces are partitioned into regions closer to one camp than others. Boundaries are perpendicular bisectors between pairs of camps.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the spatial relationship of the new camp in UMMMOOPMOS SA. Since Voronoi diagrams depend on proximity, this new camp will create a new cell and modify existing boundaries. The exact impact depends on its relative location to existing camps.\n\nStep 3: Recalculate Voronoi boundaries with the new camp. The new cell for UMMMOOPMOS SA will claim provinces closer to it than to Cordoba, Logronio, Salamanca, or SEGSOSAZ ZA. Existing cells adjacent to UMMMOOPMOS SA will shrink proportionally.\n\nStep 4: Determine affected service areas. Camps closest geographically to UMMMOOPMOS SA (e.g., if Logronio or SEGSOSAZ ZA are nearby) will lose the most territory to the new Voronoi cell. Boundaries between the new camp and neighboring original camps will shift to midpoints between them.\n\nConclusion: Adding UMMMOOPMOS SA reduces the service areas of nearby original camps, creating a new Voronoi cell centered on it. The magnitude of change depends on its geographic proximity to existing camps.\n\nQID: Management-table-211-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-211-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately follows the steps outlined in the gold answer, detailing the process of calculating Voronoi cells and the impact of adding a new camp.

Decompose the time series: $y_t = T_t \\times S_t \\times E_t$, where $E_t$ is the error term.\n2. Estimate the trend component $\\hat{T}_t$ using linear regression: $\\hat{T}_t = a + b t$.\n3.

Since Q4's constraint was binding (deviation occurred), the shadow price reflects the marginal value of additional resources in Q4.\n\nStep 3: Relate to dual values\n- The dual value of the Q4 resource constraint equals its shadow price, indicating how much the total penalty (from unmet P2 goal) would decrease for each additional unit of B^f. This quantifies the trade-off between resource availability and goal achievement priority.\n\nStep 4: Consider quarterly adjustments\n- As B^f was adjusted quarterly, the Q4-specific shadow price shows this quarter was the critical bottleneck for resource utilization, unlike Q1-Q3 where goals were achieved with existing resource levels.\n\nQID: Management-table-123-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-123-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately follows the steps outlined in the gold answer, correctly interpreting the shadow price and dual value in the context of Q4's resource overutilization and quarterly adjustments of B^f.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-123-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately follows the steps outlined in the gold answer, correctly interpreting the shadow price and dual value in the context of Q4's resource overutilization and quarterly adjustments of B^f."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-123-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer accurately follows the steps outlined in the gold answer, correctly interpreting the shadow price and dual value in the context of Q4's resource overutilization and quarterly adjustments of B^f."}

How does this volatility impact the pricing model's assumptions about demand elasticity?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the standard deviation for loaded miles: 1) List the quarterly changes: $7\\%, 2\\%, 3\\%, 4\\%, 7\\%, 9\\%$. 2) Compute the mean: $\\mu = 5\\%$. 3) Calculate squared deviations: $(7-5)^2=4$, $(2-5)^2=9$, $(3-5)^2=4$, $(4-5)^2=1$, $(7-5)^2=4$, $(9-5)^2=16$. 4) Sum of squared deviations: $4+9+4+1+4+16=38$. 5) Divide by $n$ (6): $38/6 \\approx 6.33$. 6) Take square root: $\\sigma \\approx \\sqrt{6.33} \\approx 2.52\\%$. For empty miles: 1) List changes: $-15\\%, -12\\%, -2\\%, 15\\%, 2\\%, -4\\%$. 2) Mean: $\\mu = -3\\%$. 3) Squared deviations: $144, 81, 1, 324, 25, 1$. 4) Sum: $576$. 5) Divide by 6: $96$. 6) $\\sigma \\approx \\sqrt{96} \\approx 9.80\\%$. The higher volatility in empty miles suggests greater uncertainty in operational efficiency, which may necessitate more conservative pricing strategies to account for potential inefficiencies.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract quarterly percentage changes from the table.\nLoaded Miles: 7%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 7%, 9%\nEmpty Miles: -15%, -12%, -2%, 15%, 2%, -4%\n\nStep 2: Compute standard deviation for loaded miles:\nMean (μ) = 5%\nDeviations: 2%, -3%, -2%, -1%, 2%, 4%\nSquared deviations: 4, 9, 4, 1, 4, 16\nVariance = (4+9+4+1+4+16)/6 ≈ 6.333\nStd Dev ≈ √6.333 ≈ 2.52%\n\nStep 3: Compute standard deviation for empty miles:\nMean (μ) = -3%\nDeviations: -12%, -9%, 1%, 18%, 5%, -1%\nSquared deviations: 144, 81, 1, 324, 25, 1\nVariance = (144+81+1+324+25+1)/6 = 96\nStd Dev ≈ √96 ≈ 9.80%\n\nStep 4: Analyze volatility impact:\nHigher volatility in empty miles (9.8% vs. 2.52%) implies greater demand uncertainty. This challenges the kinked demand curve's fixed elasticity assumptions (b₁ and b₂), as large demand fluctuations suggest elasticity parameters may need dynamic adjustments.

Small sample sizes (n < 30)\n\nConclusion: While there's a 1-point difference in averages, we cannot properly calculate the t-statistic or p-value required for significance testing due to missing variance measurements.

If $|M|=|S|$, the characteristic vector of $M$ is in the core. Conversely, if the core is nonempty, there exists $w$ in the core, and by Lemma 5, $w$ is a convex combination of maximum matchings, implying $|M|=|S|$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall from the Formula Context that for a minimization game (like the min vertex cover game), the core is nonempty if and only if its LP relaxation has an integer optimal solution.\n\nStep 2: The minimum vertex cover LP relaxation requires x_u + x_v ≥ 1 for every edge (u,v) and minimizes Σx_v. Konig's theorem states that in bipartite graphs (and more generally, in graphs with the König property), the minimum vertex cover size equals the maximum matching size, and the vertex cover LP has integer solutions.\n\nStep 3: When the LP has an integer solution, it corresponds to an optimal vertex cover. This implies the core allocations exist (as dual solutions align with stable payoff distributions).\n\nStep 4: Conversely, if the core is nonempty, the LP must have an integer solution by the Formula Context characterization.

From the table, for the given distribution, $P_2 = 3658$ and $TC = 648911$. If we consider a small change in $P_2$ (e.g., $\\Delta P_2 = 100$), the new $TC'$ can be approximated as $TC' = TC + \\Delta P_2 = 648911 + 100 = 649011$. Thus, $E = \\frac{(649011 - 648911) / 648911}{100 / 3658} = \\frac{100 / 648911}{100 / 3658} = \\frac{3658}{648911} \\approx 0.0056$. This low elasticity indicates that total cost is relatively inelastic to changes in promotional expenditure in period 2 for this distribution.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the row in the table with the specified borrowing distribution [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0, ..., 0]. This corresponds to the third row in the table.\nStep 2: Extract the Period 2 promotional expenditure (PE₂ = $3,658) and Total Cost (TC = $648,911) from this row.\nStep 3: Elasticity of Total Cost (TC) with respect to PE₂ is calculated as (ΔTC/TC) / (ΔPE₂/PE₂). For a linear relationship, this simplifies to (ΔTC/ΔPE₂) × (PE₂/TC).\nStep 4: Since the relationship is linear, ΔTC/ΔPE₂ is constant. Using the provided parameter β ≈ 25.0 (advertising effectiveness coefficient from the formula context) as the marginal effect of promotional expenditure on Total Cost, we substitute into the formula:\nElasticity = β × (PE₂/TC) = 25.0 × (3,658 / 648,911).\nStep 5: Compute the result: 25 × (0.005637) ≈ 0.1409.

For critical skills (n=39), the mean deviation is 5.561 with a standard deviation of 4.477. The critical t-value for $\\alpha=0.05$ and df=38 is approximately 2.024.

Since the entire interval is above zero, the performance is statistically significantly better. Similarly, for all trade skills (n>39), the mean deviation is 4.392 with a standard deviation of 3.180.

Using the formula for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lev}}^{\\prime}(\\lambda)$, explain why Algorithm 2 might be slower despite its theoretical guarantees.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The computational complexity of Algorithm 2 depends on evaluating $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lev}}^{\\prime}(\\lambda)$ at each iteration, which requires $O(n)$ operations due to the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathrm{max}\\{|x_{i}|-\\lambda,0\\}$.\n\nStep 2: For $n=10^6$, each evaluation is expensive.

Derive the reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$ required to achieve the 'New' result, assuming the total size of added or deleted jobs is $P$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo achieve the 'New' result of $1+\\varepsilon$, the reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$ must satisfy $\\sum_{j\\in J_{R}}p_{j} \\leq r(\\varepsilon) \\cdot P$, where $P$ is the total size of added or deleted jobs.

What is the minimum number of colors ($k$) required?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify vertices $V$ from the table: Algebra, Geometry, Biology, Chemistry.\n\nStep 2: Determine edges $E$ based on student conflicts:\n- Anjuli is enrolled in Algebra, Geometry, Biology (double), and Chemistry. Thus, conflicts exist between:\n  - Algebra and Geometry\n  - Algebra and Biology\n  - Algebra and Chemistry\n  - Geometry and Biology\n  - Geometry and Chemistry\n  - Biology and Chemistry\n- Gerald is enrolled in Geometry, so no additional conflicts.\n- Mitchell is enrolled in Algebra and Biology, adding a conflict between Algebra and Biology (already included).\n\nStep 3: Compute degrees of each vertex:\n- Algebra: conflicts with Geometry, Biology, Chemistry → degree 3\n- Geometry: conflicts with Algebra, Biology, Chemistry → degree 3\n- Biology: conflicts with Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry → degree 3\n- Chemistry: conflicts with Algebra, Geometry, Biology → degree 3\n\nStep 4: Apply largest degree first heuristic.

Assume criteria include technological feasibility, economic impact, and environmental benefits.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo prioritize the fields using MCDA, follow these steps:\n1. **Define Criteria Weights**: Assign weights $w_i$ to each criterion (e.g., $w_1 = 0.4$ for technological feasibility, $w_2 = 0.3$ for economic impact, $w_3 = 0.3$ for environmental benefits).\n2. **Score Each Field**: For each field (e.g., 'Propulsion'), score $s_{ij}$ from 1-5 for each criterion $j$.\n3. **Calculate Weighted Scores**: Compute $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^3 w_j s_{ij}$ for each field.\n4. **Rank Fields**: Sort fields by $S_i$ in descending order. For example, if 'Propulsion' scores $S_i = 4.2$ and 'Aesthetics' scores $S_i = 2.8$, prioritize 'Propulsion' higher.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Establish Evaluation Matrix\nCreate a matrix with all research fields (Advanced HSGT Concepts, Aesthetics, Vehicle/Guideway, etc.) as rows and the three criteria (Technological Feasibility, Economic Impact, Environmental Benefits) as columns.\n\nStep 2: Assign Criteria Weights\nUse expert input to assign weights to each criterion (e.g., 40% Technological Feasibility, 35% Economic Impact, 25% Environmental Benefits). These weights should reflect organizational priorities.\n\nStep 3: Normalize Scoring Scales\nDefine a 1-10 scoring system for each criterion:\n- Technological Feasibility: Technical complexity and implementation timeline\n- Economic Impact: Job creation potential and ROI\n- Environmental Benefits: Emissions reduction and sustainability impact\n\nStep 4: Score Each Field\nConduct expert assessments to score each research field across all criteria. Example:\n- 'Propulsion' might score 8/10 Technological Feasibility\n- 'New Cities' might score 9/10 Environmental Benefits\n- 'Finance' might score 7/10 Economic Impact\n\nStep 5: Calculate Weighted Scores\nFor each field: (Tech Score × Tech Weight) + (Econ Score × Econ Weight) + (Env Score × Env Weight)\n\nStep 6: Prioritize Fields\nRank research fields by descending total weighted scores.

The NW-method starts by allocating the maximum possible flow to the northwest (top-left) corner of the transportation matrix and iteratively moves to adjacent cells to satisfy the remaining supply and demand constraints. This method ensures integrality of the solution because it operates on integer-valued supplies and demands, and each allocation step involves integer arithmetic. The integrality is preserved because the NW-method only adds or subtracts integer values, ensuring that the final solution is integral if the input capacities $h$ and bound $q$ are integral.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand Contextual Relationships\nThe transportation problem derived from matroid M and LP \\(\tilde{P}(M,l,h,q)\\) inherits combinatorial structure from matroid theory and LP constraints. The NW-corner rule is a constructive method for transportation problems.\n\nStep 2: Role of NW-Method in Initialization\nThe NW-corner rule provides an initial basic feasible solution by sequentially allocating maximum possible quantities starting from the top-left cell (like a transportation tableau), respecting supply/demand constraints derived from matroid M's structure through matrix H in \\(\tilde{P}\\).\n\nStep 3: Integrality Preservation Mechanism\n1. Matroid Unimodularity: Matroid-derived constraint matrices (H in \\(\tilde{P}\\)) often exhibit total unimodularity, ensuring LP solutions are integral when supplies/demands (h,q) are integers.\n2. Discrete Allocation: The NW-corner rule only makes integer allocations at each step, as it moves strictly horizontally/vertically through the solution space without splitting units.\n3. Combinatorial Alignment: The matroid's independent set structure ensures allocations correspond to rank functions, maintaining integrality through greedy-like NW allocations.\n\nStep 4: Connection to \\(\tilde{P}(M,l,h,q)\\) Constraints\nThe additional objective constraint \\(1\\cdot\tilde{v} \\leq q\\) acts as a demand cap.

The denominator involves $\\min_P \\{\\gamma_P\\}$, the smallest gain product over paths, and $\\min_{j,\\gamma_C \\neq 1} \\{1, \\gamma_j, |1 - \\gamma_C|\\}$, the smallest deviation from unity gain. If gain factors are close to 1, $M$ remains small, ensuring efficient convergence. However, if $\\min_P \\{\\gamma_P\\}$ is very small or $\\max_{j,C} |1 - \\gamma_C|$ is large, $M$ increases, leading to higher complexity. This highlights the sensitivity of the method to the network's gain structure.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the role of gain factors in generalized network flow.\nGain factors γ_j modify flow quantities across arcs (e.g., flow x_j becomes γ_jx_j at the destination). Unlike ordinary networks, this introduces multiplicative scaling, affecting flow conservation constraints.\n\nStep 2: Relate gain factors to the complexity bound M.\nThe table shows generalized network flow complexity includes a factor M not present in ordinary flows. This M likely depends on γ_j, as gains amplify/reduce flow magnitudes, requiring tighter variable bounds in the algorithm.\n\nStep 3: Analyze how γ_j influences M.\nSuppose M = Π_j max{γ_j, 1/γ_j} (common in generalized flow analyses). Larger deviations of γ_j from 1 (e.g., γ_j ≫ 1 or γ_j ≪ 1) increase M exponentially. This aligns with M being omitted in ordinary flows (where γ_j ≡ 1).\n\nStep 4: Connect to ε-out-of-kilter mechanics.\nThe method reduces vertical distances (κ_j) to characteristic curves. Gain factors distort the relationship between primal flows x_j and dual variables t_j, necessitating additional iterations or larger bounds to achieve ε-complementary slackness (f_j^{-}(x_j) ≤ t_j ≤ f_j^{+}(x_j) + ε).\n\nConclusion: Gain factors γ_j increase M multiplicatively in the complexity bound O(m³ log(∈₀/∈₁)M), with M scaling with magnitudes of γ_j (e.g., max_j γ_j / min_j γ_j), worsening the bound as gains deviate from 1.\n\nQID: Management-table-626-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-626-1\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies that gain factors affect the complexity bound M and that deviations from unity gain increase M.

Activity 12 (Maintenance, updating & improvements of job skills):\n   - Human Abilities effect: Not shown (assume 0)\n   - GNP reduction: -10\n\nSince Activity 10 shows Human Abilities improvement without GNP impact, while Activity 12 shows GNP reduction without Human Abilities impact, we cannot calculate a direct ratio. This suggests these activities affect different dimensions independently, highlighting the multidimensional nature of quality-of-life trade-offs.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant columns for Human Abilities and GNP in Table 2.

For the first 15 minutes, the queue durations are: 8:38.02-8:39.05 (63 seconds), 8:40.32-8:40.55 (23 seconds), 8:41.11-8:42.05 (54 seconds), 8:43.29-8:43.45 (16 seconds), 8:45.24-8:46.12 (48 seconds). The average queue duration during rush hour is (63 + 23 + 54 + 16 + 48)/5 = 204/5 = 40.8 seconds. For the second 15 minutes, the queue duration is 8:50.00-8:50.30 (30 seconds). The average queue duration during non-rush hour is 30 seconds. The longer average queue duration during rush hour supports the claim that Assumption 2 (passengers arriving in lumps and experiencing delays) is more valid during this period, whereas the shorter queue during non-rush hour indicates minimal delays.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify all queue durations from Table I:\n- 8:38.02 to 8:39.05 = 63 sec\n- 8:40.32 to 8:40.55 = 23 sec\n- 8:41.11 to 8:42.05 = 54 sec\n- 8:43.29 to 8:43.45 = 16 sec\n- 8:45.24 to 8:46.12 = 48 sec\n- 8:50.00 to 8:50.30 = 30 sec\n\nStep 2: Determine time windows:\n- First 15 minutes (rush hour): 8:37.57 to 8:52.57 (all 6 queues occur here)\n- Second 15 minutes (non-rush): 8:52.57 to 9:07.57 (no queues occur)\n\nStep 3: Calculate averages:\n- Rush hour: (63 + 23 + 54 + 16 + 48 + 30)/6 = 234/6 = 39 sec average\n- Non-rush hour: 0 sec average (no queues)\n\nStep 4: Relate to Assumption 2:\nThe presence of measurable queue durations (39 sec avg) during rush hour suggests active queue formation/clearance dynamics required by Assumption 2.

Cost per unit = $7,100 / 1,420 ≈ $5.00. Step 2: For third-order, obsolescence loss is $4,580 and final inventory is 916 units. Cost per unit = $4,580 / 916 ≈ $5.00.

From Table 1, $R_1 = 1.02$ and $C_1 = 0.03$. Plugging these values into the formula gives $F(j=\\alpha_{0})=1-(1.02-1)/0.03=1-0.02/0.03=1-2/3=1/3$.

For example, if UPNA-GILT and CENER have high interdependencies ($I_{ij} = 0.8$) and frequent communication ($C_{ij} = 0.9$), their contribution to $E$ would be $0.8\\alpha + 0.9\\beta$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze task interdependencies (I_ij) between institutions based on their respective responsibilities. For example:\n- CENER (Biomass characterization) ↔ AIN (Biorefinery design) would have high I_ij\n- INTIA (Biomass evaluation) ↔ UPNA-GILT (Supply chain design) would have medium I_ij\n\nStep 2: Establish that communication frequency (C_ij) should align with task interdependencies for optimal efficiency. The collaboration efficiency E should:\n- Increase when C_ij matches required coordination level indicated by I_ij\n- Account for all institution pairs (i,j)\n\nStep 3: Propose a normalized efficiency function using scalar product:\nE = (Σ I_ij * C_ij) / (Σ I_ij^2)^0.5 * (Σ C_ij^2)^0.5\n\nThis formulation:\n1. Uses cosine similarity to measure alignment between actual communication (C_ij) and required coordination (I_ij)\n2. Automatically normalizes values between 0-1\n3. Penalizes both under-communication (low C_ij for high I_ij) and over-communication (high C_ij for low I_ij)\n\nStep 4: For practical implementation in MILP frameworks mentioned in the context, this efficiency measure could be incorporated as:\n- An objective function component\n- A constraint for minimum collaboration effectiveness\n- A weighting factor in transportation/storage cost calculations\n\nQID: Management-table-308-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-308-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer provides a detailed and mathematically sound approach to modeling collaboration efficiency, aligning well with the gold answer's concept of combining task interdependencies and communication frequency.

This is because the core is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of edges, which correspond to the minimal colorings in a bipartite graph. The conditions $w(S)\\leq 1$ for independent sets $S$ and $w(L\\cup R)=2$ ensure that $w$ is a convex combination of edge vectors.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the core conditions. For a minimum coloring game on bipartite graph G=(L,R,E), an imputation w is in the core iff:\n1. Efficiency: ∑_{v∈L∪R} w(v) = χ(G) = 2\n2. Coalitional rationality: ∀S⊆L∪R, ∑_{v∈S} w(v) ≥ χ(S)\n\nStep 2: Analyze bipartite structure. Since G is bipartite:\n- All edges connect L-R\n- Any independent set S is entirely contained in L or R\n- χ(S) = 1 for independent sets, χ(S) = 2 otherwise\n\nStep 3: Show characteristic vectors of edges satisfy core conditions:\n- For edge e=(u,v), its characteristic vector assigns w(u)=w(v)=1 (others 0)\n- Convex combinations preserve efficiency (total=2)\n- For any independent set S: ∑_{v∈S} w(v) ≤ 1 (since edges only connect L-R)\n- For non-independent sets: ∑w ≥ 2 holds automatically\n\nStep 4: Prove reverse inclusion. Let w be in core:\n1. From efficiency: ∑_{L} w(v) + ∑_{R} w(v) = 2\n2. From independent set constraints: ∑_{L} w(v) ≤ 1 and ∑_{R} w(v) ≤ 1 ⇒ ∑_{L} w(v) = ∑_{R} w(v) = 1\n3. Construct λ_e coefficients: For each edge e=(u,v), let λ_e = min(w(u), w(v))\n4. Using induction/bipartite flow decomposition, show w can be expressed as convex combination of edge vectors\n\nConclusion: Core imputations exactly correspond to convex combinations of edge characteristic vectors because they satisfy all core constraints and bipartite structure allows decomposition via edge-based coefficients.\n\nQID: Management-table-642-4\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-642-4\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly addresses the proof by breaking it down into logical steps, correctly analyzing the bipartite structure, and demonstrating both directions of the 'if and only if' condition.

Since each truck has a capacity of 20 units, which is greater than 14, a truck can be assigned to this route.

Advantages: It provides a more balanced representation of market prices over the month, accounting for daily fluctuations. Disadvantages: It lacks basis in actual sales practices, as no contracts stipulate a 70/30 split. In contrast, the FOM price is readily available and commonly used, but it does not reflect price changes after the first of the month.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand Price Mechanisms\nThe FOM goal price uses a formula that switches between NYMEX price adjustments (when monthly changes exceed 12%) and Henry Hub daily averages. The 70/30 goal price would theoretically blend 70% NYMEX and 30% Henry Hub prices.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Volatility Handling\nThe FOM method reacts to extreme price movements (>12% changes) with formulaic adjustments, making it more responsive to market shocks. The 70/30 method provides inherent smoothing through fixed weighting, reducing volatility exposure.\n\nStep 3: Compare Performance in Key Months\n- In Apr-01: 70/30 would create higher goal price (5.37 vs 5.20), increasing losses\n- In Oct-01: 70/30 goal (2.01) would be lower than formula-based goal (2.04), reducing losses\n- In Jul-01: 70/30 goal (3.30) would decrease gains compared to formula's lower goal (3.07)\n\nStep 4: Identify Advantages of 70/30\n1. Price Stability: Blended approach reduces extreme goal price fluctuations\n2. Predictability: Fixed weighting simplifies royalty calculations\n3. Risk Mitigation: Limits exposure to single price index anomalies\n\nStep 5: Identify Disadvantages of 70/30\n1. Opportunity Cost: May miss gains from favorable price spikes captured by FOM formula\n2. Systematic Bias: Consistently weights NYMEX more despite potential market shifts\n3. Reduced Responsiveness: Fixed ratio cannot adapt to severe market changes like the 12% threshold mechanism\n\nStep 6: Evaluate Total Impact\nThe FOM method resulted in ($485,620) total loss. While 70/30 might reduce losses in some months (like Oct-01), it could increase them in others (like Apr-01), creating trade-offs between stability and optimization potential.\n\nQID: Management-table-62-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-62-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate provides a detailed analysis of the 70/30 goal price versus the FOM goal price, including volatility handling and performance in key months.

How would you derive optimal weights $w_i^*$ to align sub-unit goals with organizational objectives?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive optimal weights $w_i^*$ for aligning sub-unit goals with organizational objectives, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Optimization Problem**: \n   Maximize $U = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i g_i$ subject to constraints representing organizational resources and interdependencies among sub-units.\n\n2. **Introduce Constraints**: \n   For example, if total resources are limited to $R$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i g_i \\leq R$, where $c_i$ is the cost per unit of goal $g_i$.\n\n3. **Formulate the Lagrangian**: \n   $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i g_i - \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i g_i - R\\right)$.\n\n4. **First-Order Conditions**: \n   Take partial derivatives with respect to $g_i$ and set to zero: \n   $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial g_i} = w_i - \\lambda c_i = 0 \\implies w_i = \\lambda c_i$.\n\n5. **Solve for $\\lambda$**: \n   Substitute $w_i = \\lambda c_i$ into the resource constraint to solve for $\\lambda$.\n\n6. **Optimal Weights**: \n   The optimal weights are proportional to the cost-effectiveness of each sub-unit's goal: $w_i^* \\propto \\frac{1}{c_i}$.\n\nThis ensures that sub-unit goals contributing more to organizational utility per unit cost receive higher weights.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Define the organizational utility function as \\( U = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i g_i \\), where \\( g_i \\) represents measurable outcomes of sub-unit goals and \\( w_i \\) are their relative importance weights.\\n\\nStep 2: Establish organizational objectives (e.g., profit maximization, risk minimization) as constraints or an upper-level optimization target.

The calculation is as follows: $A_{Car CTOL} = 0.7402 \\times 0.40 + 0.7356 \\times 0.29 + 0.6893 \\times 0.15 + 1.0000 \\times 0.06 + 0.7191 \\times (-0.05) + 0.8434 \\times (-0.10) + 0.6760 \\times 0.19 + 0.7733 \\times 0.00 = 0.29608 + 0.213324 + 0.103395 + 0.06 - 0.035955 - 0.08434 + 0.12844 + 0 = 0.680944$.

When W_Y = I_r (first row of table), the gap coefficient bounds between Mi+ (embedded) and M+ (quotient) geometries are [20κ(X), 401κ(X)], where κ(X) = σ_max/σ_min is the condition number of X.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that these bounds directly link the Riemannian Hessian relationships. The Hessian operator spectrum under the embedded geometry is scaled by factors proportional to κ(X) when compared to the quotient geometry.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the impact: Larger κ(X) amplifies the spectral gap between geometries, meaning ill-conditioned X (high κ(X)) causes greater disparity in Hessian curvature between embedded and quotient geometries. Conversely, well-conditioned X (κ(X) ≈ 1) minimizes this discrepancy.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that κ(X) linearly controls the tightness of the Hessian relationship bounds.

The heuristic search prioritizes nodes with lower $h$, which correspond to nodes with lower $f$.\\n2. **First Node Optimality**: The first node $P_{i} \\in \\mathfrak{G}$ selected has the minimal $h$, and thus minimal $f$. Hence, $f(P_{i}) = f(P_{0})$.\\n3. **No Further Decomposition**: After selecting $P_{i}$, no other nodes are decomposed because $f(P_{i})$ is already optimal. Thus, the computation process is identical for any $\\epsilon$, and $T(0) = T(\\epsilon)$.\\n4. **Theorem 5.2**: This result is formalized in Theorem 5.2, which states that $T(0) = T(\\epsilon)$ when the first node selected is optimal.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the nonmisleading heuristic property. A nonmisleading heuristic ensures all generated nodes satisfy f(P_i) ≥ f(P₀), where f(P₀) represents the minimal possible cost (i.e., the optimal solution value). This prevents underestimation of true costs.\n\nStep 2: Prove f(P_i) = f(P₀) for the first selected node. When expanding P₀, its children inherit f-values ≥ f(P₀) due to the nonmisleading property. The algorithm prioritizes nodes with minimal f-value, so the first selected node must have f(P_i) = f(P₀) (as no smaller value exists).\n\nStep 3: Link to T(0) = T(ε). Since all processed nodes have f-values exactly equal to f(P₀) (the optimal value), relaxing the bound via ε > 0 cannot prune additional nodes. The allowance condition g(P_i) ≥ z - ε(z) is automatically satisfied when g(P_i) = z (the optimal value), leaving the node count T(ε) unchanged from T(0).\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-494-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nFor the WHARD network, optimizing $E(w)$ under deterministic travel times yields a 3.0% decrease in $E(w)$ but a 1.3% decrease in $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$. Compare this to the probabilistic optimization case where $E(w)$ decreases by 35.5% and $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$ by 61.2%. Formulate a mathematical explanation for why probabilistic optimization yields significantly better results.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nProbabilistic optimization accounts for the randomness in travel times, which affects both $E(w)$ and $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$. The expected waiting time $E(w)$ under random travel times is influenced by the headway distribution and transfer coordination. The deterministic model assumes fixed travel times, leading to suboptimal coordination. The probabilistic model minimizes $E(w) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w f(w) dw$, where $f(w)$ is the waiting time distribution. By optimizing this integral, the model better aligns transfer times, reducing both mean and variance. The larger improvements (35.5% vs 3.0% for $E(w)$) highlight the importance of stochastic modeling in transit networks.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that deterministic optimization assumes fixed travel times, limiting its ability to account for uncertainty. This restricts optimization to a single scenario, only marginally improving both expected disutility ($E(w)$) and its variance ($\\mathbf{Var}(w)$).\n\nStep 2: In probabilistic optimization, travel times are modeled as random variables. This allows the objective function to explicitly consider the statistical relationship between $E(w)$ and $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = E(w^2) - [E(w)]^2$, creating opportunities for deeper trade-offs between mean performance and variability.\n\nStep 3: The probabilistic framework enables simultaneous minimization of both terms in $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$. Reductions in $E(w^2)$ (visible in WHARD's -48.8% value) directly amplify variance reduction beyond what deterministic methods achieve, as variance depends quadratically on deviations from the mean.\n\nStep 4: By optimizing across the full probability distribution of travel times rather than a single deterministic value, probabilistic methods reduce path dependencies and avoid local minima that persist in deterministic formulations. This leads to globally better solutions for both $E(w)$ and $\\mathbf{Var}(w)$.\n\nQID: Management-table-494-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-494-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer thoroughly explains why probabilistic optimization yields better results by detailing the limitations of deterministic models and the advantages of probabilistic methods, including handling uncertainty and optimizing across distributions.

Same path—no tax (81.2%) + New path—cost decrease (11.5%) = 92.7%.\nStep 2: Interpretation. 92.7% of shipments are Pareto-improved or unaffected, suggesting TS is near-Pareto efficient for most carriers.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant definitions from Table 7. TS refers to the toll-setting problem, and % chg represents the percentage change in costs from the ND (network design) model to the TS model.\n\nStep 2: Calculate % chg for shipments using the formula: \n% chg = (TS_cost − ND_cost)/ND_cost × 100. A negative % chg indicates a cost decrease, 0% indicates no change, and a positive % chg indicates an increase.\n\nStep 3: To find the probability of no cost change or a decrease, count the number of shipments with % chg ≤ 0 and divide by the total number of shipments. For example, if 70% of shipments show ≤0% chg, the probability is 0.7.\n\nStep 4: For Pareto efficiency implications: If all shipments have % chg ≤ 0 (i.e., no entity is worse off under TS compared to ND), the TS solution is Pareto efficient.

Show step-by-step how the transformation function affects the cut density.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the worst-case approximation ratio for the algorithm from [31] when $u_1 = 0.23$ and $u_2 = 0.23$, we follow these steps: 1) Evaluate the transformation function $f_i(u)$ at $u_i = 0.23$. Since $\\sqrt{5}-2 \\approx 0.236 > 0.23$, we use the first case: $$f_i(0.23) = \\frac{4+2\\sqrt{5}}{6} \\times (0.23)^2 \\approx 0.072.$$ 2) The worst cut density for [31] is $(3+\\sqrt{5})/4 \\approx 1.3207$, attained when $(1,2)$ change and $u_1 \\geq 0.23, u_2 \\leq 0.23$. Here, $u_1 = u_2 = 0.23$ lies on the boundary. 3) The transformation function's linear partial derivatives ensure the cut density is balanced, leading to the approximation ratio of $1.3207$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Verify the applicable piecewise function. Since u₁ = u₂ = 0.23 are less than √5 − 2 ≈ 0.236, we use the first case of the transformation function: fᵢ(u) = (4 + 2√5)/6 · u².\n\nStep 2: Calculate transformed values. For each uᵢ = 0.23:\nfᵢ(0.23) = (4 + 2√5)/6 · (0.23)² ≈ (8.472/6) · 0.0529 ≈ 1.412 · 0.0529 ≈ 0.0747.\nThus, u₁' ≈ u₂' ≈ 0.0747.\n\nStep 3: Substitute transformed values into the cut density formula.

Consider the cost structures and capacity constraints.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo minimize costs, prioritize bulk storage due to lower costs. Allocate up to 280,000 bbls to Frostway (bulk), but given only 100,000 bbls: $100,000 \\times 1.28 = 128,000$ for bulk. If bulk capacity is exceeded, use bagged storage: $100,000 \\times 1.45 = 145,000$. However, since bulk capacity (335,000) > 100,000, optimal cost is $128,000$ using bulk storage only.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate total cost per barrel for each storage option.\n- Bulk: Frostwayb = 0.25 (Freight) + 0.81 (Initial) + 0.22 (Continuing) = $1.28/bbl\n- Bulk: Inland = 0.30 + 0.76 + 0.23 = $1.29/bbl\n- Bagged: Farmers = 0.29 + 0.76 + 0.23 = $1.28/bbl\nOther bagged options (Northern, American, Freeze-Rite) have higher costs ($1.31-$2.28/bbl).\n\nStep 2: Identify cheapest options with capacity constraints.\nBoth Frostwayb (bulk) and Farmers (bagged) have identical $1.28/bbl cost. Frostwayb has 280,000 bbl capacity (sufficient for full 100k), while Farmers is limited to 75,000 bbl.\n\nStep 3: Optimize allocation to respect capacity.\nTo minimize cost while adhering to Farmers' 75k limit:\n- Allocate 75,000 bbl to Farmers (bagged)\n- Allocate remaining 25,000 bbl to Frostwayb (bulk)\n\nTotal cost = (75,000 × $1.28) + (25,000 × $1.28) = $128,000.\n\nAlternative: Storing all 100k in Frostwayb bulk yields identical total cost but does not utilize bagged capacity.

The steps are as follows:\n1. **Fix a Coordinate**: Transform the problem so that the characteristic plane is $x = 0$. Fix $x = a$ and solve the resulting two-variable problem on this plane.\n2. **Check Optimality**: The solution on $x = a$ is optimal if the relaxation (parallelogram or triangle) on this plane has no lattice points in front or back. If the relaxation has lattice points in front, the optimal solution must satisfy $x \\geq a$; if it has lattice points in back, the optimal solution must satisfy $x \\leq a$.\n3. **Bisection Search**: Use bisection on the range of $x$ to narrow down the optimal solution. For each midpoint $a$, solve the two-variable problem and adjust the range based on the presence of lattice points in front or back.\n\nThis procedure decouples the three-variable problem into a series of two-variable problems, making it computationally tractable.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify coprime integers p and q from the constraints.

Here, $\\mathfrak{s t}(x,\\mathcal{E})$ denotes the star of $x$ in the complex $\\mathcal{E}$, which includes all facets containing $x$. Similarly, $\\mathfrak{s t}(y,\\mathcal{E})$ includes all facets containing $y$. The intersection $\\mathfrak{s t}(x,\\mathcal{E})\\cap\\mathfrak{s t}(y,\\mathcal{E})$ consists of facets containing both $x$ and $y$, which should exactly equal $\\mathfrak{s t}(x y,\\mathcal{E})$, the star of the edge $xy$. If this equality holds, then by Lemma 6.1, the edge $xy$ is shrinkable. For the given polytope, this condition fails for all edges, as shown in the proof of Theorem 6.3, confirming that no edge is shrinkable.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the vertices x and y forming the edge in question. Since they aren't explicitly provided, we assume x and y are vertices listed in the facet table (e.g., from labels like a, b, c, etc.).\nStep 2: Extract all facets containing x (st(x, E)) from the table. These are rows/cells where x appears in the 4-vertex simplex.\nStep 3: Similarly, extract all facets containing y (st(y, E)).\nStep 4: Compute the intersection of st(x, E) and st(y, E). These are facets that include both x and y.\nStep 5: Extract st(xy, E), which are facets explicitly containing the edge xy (both x and y as vertices).\nStep 6: Compare the intersection (Step 4) with st(xy, E). If they match, the edge is shrinkable.

The objective function is $\\max \\sum_{i=1}^{12} \\sum_{j=1}^{12} P_{ij} x_{ij}$, where $P_{ij}$ is the probability that Team USA golfer $i$ wins against Team Europe golfer $j$, and $x_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating the assignment. Constraints ensure each golfer is assigned to exactly one match. Solving this using the Hungarian algorithm or linear programming yields the optimal lineup. For example, assigning Team USA golfer 4 to match 1 (75% win probability) and golfer 2 to match 6 (79% win probability) would be part of an optimal strategy.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Parse the table to identify probability values. The HTML table contains 12 Team USA golfers (rows 1-12) with win probabilities against 12 opponents (columns 1-12), though formatting issues require careful extraction of numeric values between 20-80 that represent percentage probabilities.\n\nStep 2: Clean the data by removing non-numeric entries and rows containing redundant '12' values. For example, ignore rows with Chinese text and repeated '12's that appear to be formatting artifacts.\n\nStep 3: Recognize non-transitive dependencies mean traditional ranking approaches won't work - Golfer A > B > C doesn't guarantee A > C. This requires analyzing pairwise matchups rather than absolute rankings.\n\nStep 4: Construct a 12x12 matrix where rows represent US golfers and columns represent opponents, with cell values being the cleaned probabilities from the table.\n\nStep 5: Use the Hungarian Algorithm to solve this assignment problem, maximizing the total win probability. This algorithm optimally matches each US golfer to one opponent while respecting the constraint that all matches must be paired uniquely.\n\nStep 6: Convert probabilities to costs by subtracting from 100 (since Hungarian minimizes cost), then apply the algorithm to find pairings that maximize the sum of probabilities.\n\nStep 7: Verify results by checking key high-value matchups like Golfer 4 vs Opponent 10 (79% probability) and Golfer 6 vs Opponent 11 (78% probability) are included in the optimal assignment.\n\nFinal Optimal Lineup: The maximum-weight matching solution would strategically pair golfers with their strongest probabilistic matchups while accounting for the non-transitive nature of outcomes, likely featuring combinations like (G4 vs O11), (G2 vs O6), (G10 vs O4), and other high-probability matches from the cleaned matrix.\n\nQID: Management-table-246-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-246-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly outlines the steps to solve the assignment problem using the Hungarian Algorithm, including data cleaning and handling non-transitive dependencies, aligning with the gold answer's methodology.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-246-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly outlines the steps to solve the assignment problem using the Hungarian Algorithm, including data cleaning and handling non-transitive dependencies, aligning with the gold answer's methodology."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-246-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly outlines the steps to solve the assignment problem using the Hungarian Algorithm, including data cleaning and handling non-transitive dependencies, aligning with the gold answer's methodology."}

TS IO is 30x faster.\nStep 2: Compare PopExp. Both models yield identical PopExp = 481.38 million persons.\nStep 3: Compare Dist. Both models yield identical Dist = 27.86 million km.\nStep 4: Conclusion. TS IO achieves the same solution quality with significantly lower computational effort, making it more efficient.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the models to compare. ND PD IS (model 8) combines network design with primal-dual equality and an initial solution from TS. TS IO (model 10) uses inverse optimization. Step 2: Analyze CPU time. From Table 2 (hypothetical data), ND PD IS likely has lower CPU minutes due to its pre-constructed initial solution (IS) reducing B&B nodes/cuts, while TS IO requires iterative IO processes, increasing computation. Step 3: Evaluate PopExp/Dist. TS IO may show improved PopExp/Dist metrics (lower values) as inverse optimization tailors tolls to optimize these objectives, while ND PD IS focuses on network design trade-offs.

Generally, correlations ≥ |0.5| with n ≥ 30 are likely significant at p < 0.05, but this cannot be confirmed without explicit data.\n\nStep 2: The comparison to the 'Publications-Citations' correlation is unanswerable with the given information. While 'Citations to published materials' appears in the table as a qualitative measure, no Spearman coefficient value for this relationship is provided in the question or table. A meaningful comparison requires both correlation values and their significance metrics.\n\nConclusion: The significance of r = 0.581 remains indeterminate without sample size/p-value data, and no comparison can be made to the 'Publications-Citations' correlation due to missing numerical values.\n\nQID: Management-table-770-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-770-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer incorrectly states that the significance and comparison cannot be determined due to missing data, while the gold answer clearly provides the necessary information (p < 0.001 significance and correlation values for both relationships).\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-770-0", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer incorrectly states that the significance and comparison cannot be determined due to missing data, while the gold answer clearly provides the necessary information (p < 0.001 significance and correlation values for both relationships)."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-770-0", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer incorrectly states that the significance and comparison cannot be determined due to missing data, while the gold answer clearly provides the necessary information (p < 0.001 significance and correlation values for both relationships)."}
{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-721-1", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nUsing the singular market share equation $m^*(t) = \\frac{K_1 \\lambda_1 S(t)}{\\alpha + \\lambda_1 A_2(t)}$, analyze how a 10% increase in competitors' goodwill $A_2(t)$ affects the optimal market share and advertising expenditure, given the parameters for Winston.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nA 10% increase in $A_2(t)$ decreases the denominator of $m^*(t)$, thus reducing the singular market share. From the equation, $\\frac{\\partial m^*}{\\partial A_2} = -\\frac{K_1 \\lambda_1^2 S(t)}{(\\alpha + \\lambda_1 A_2(t))^2} < 0$. For advertising expenditure, the optimal policy adjusts to reach the new $m^*(t)$. If $A_2(t)$ increases, the firm must increase advertising to counteract the loss in market share, as per the pulse condition (17). The exact change depends on the parameters $K_1$, $\\lambda_1$, and the values of $S(t)$ and $A_2(t)$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the market share equation: m*(t) = (K₁λ₁S(t))/(α + λ₁A₂(t)). A 10% increase in A₂(t) increases the denominator, decreasing m*(t).\n\nStep 2: Calculate proportional impact: Original denominator = α + λ₁A₂(t). New denominator = α + 1.1λ₁A₂(t). Market share decreases by Δm* ≈ - (λ₁A₂(t))/(α + λ₁A₂(t)) * 10% (partial derivative basis).\n\nStep 3: Advertising expenditure implications: Since m*(t) decreases with higher A₂(t), Winston would need to increase advertising spending to maintain market share (if maintaining share is prioritized), as competitor goodwill acts as a counteracting force.\n\nStep 4: Profit considerations: The table shows optimal profits are sensitive to market conditions. Reduced market share from higher A₂(t) would pressure margins, requiring advertising budget rebalancing to maintain profitability levels shown in the optimal profits row.\n\nQID: Management-table-721-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-721-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the decrease in market share due to increased competitor goodwill and the need for increased advertising expenditure, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-721-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the decrease in market share due to increased competitor goodwill and the need for increased advertising expenditure, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-721-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the decrease in market share due to increased competitor goodwill and the need for increased advertising expenditure, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions."}

How does this compare to the correlation with 'Independent' total performance, and what does this imply about the robustness of the combined measure?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nIn Table 3, the correlation between 'Papers Refereed + Publications' and 'Dependent' total performance is 0.880, while the correlation with 'Independent' total performance is 0.790. The 'Dependent' total performance includes the rank of the variable itself, whereas the 'Independent' total performance excludes it. The high correlation (0.880) suggests that the combined measure is strongly associated with the overall performance index. The slightly lower correlation (0.790) with the 'Independent' index indicates that the relationship remains robust even when the variable's own contribution is excluded. This implies that 'Papers Refereed + Publications' is a reliable predictor of total research performance, as confirmed by the Kendall partial correlation analysis.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key variables - The correlation between 'Papers Refereed + Publications' and 'Dependent' total performance is 0.880. We need to compare this to its correlation with 'Independent' total performance.\n\nStep 2: Interpret correlation differences - If the correlation with 'Independent' total performance is lower than 0.880, it suggests the initial high correlation with 'Dependent' performance may be partially inflated by methodological overlap (e.g., if 'Papers Refereed + Publications' is itself a component of the 'Dependent' index).\n\nStep 3: Assess robustness implications - A weaker correlation with the 'Independent' index would indicate that the combined measure's predictive power is less generalizable when evaluated against a performance metric that doesn't include it.

ProModelPC vs. XCELL+: ProModelPC has more features (17 > 9.5) and lower cost ($7000 < $8000). Thus, XCELL+ is dominated.\n2.

What is the Nash equilibrium if the payoff for each member is $U_o = T \\cdot R - c(R)$, where $c(R)$ is the cost of being reliable?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Assume two players with payoffs $U_{o1} = T_1 R_1 - c(R_1)$ and $U_{o2} = T_2 R_2 - c(R_2)$. Step 2: In a cooperative game, trust is mutual, so $T_1 = T_2 = T$. Step 3: The Nash equilibrium requires each player to choose $R_i$ to maximize their payoff given the other's choice. Step 4: The first-order condition is $\\frac{\\partial U_{oi}}{\\partial R_i} = T - c'(R_i) = 0$. Step 5: The equilibrium reliability $R^*$ satisfies $c'(R^*) = T$. Higher trust leads to higher equilibrium reliability.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify strategic variables. In this cooperative game, other-directed personalities optimize utility Uₒ = T·R - c(R) where Trust (T) and Reliability (R) are interdependent. The table associates other-directed personalities with Trust (status) and Reliability (jurisdiction).\n\nStep 2: Assume symmetry in Nash equilibrium. All players adopt identical strategies due to cooperative context and shared norms. Let each player's trust level T depend on others' Reliability choices (R). In a simplified symmetric case where T = R (trust emerges from observed reliability), utility becomes Uₒ = R² - c(R).\n\nStep 3: Derive equilibrium condition. Maximize Uₒ with respect to R: dUₒ/dR = 2R - c’(R) = 0 ⇒ c’(R) = 2R. However, under mutual dependency (where T reacts to others' R), equilibrium requires accounting for strategic interaction. If T scales with others' average R and assuming full symmetry, the final Nash equilibrium satisfies c’(R) = R (marginal cost of reliability equals reliability itself).\n\nStep 4: Interpret result. At equilibrium, players maintain reliability levels where the marginal cost of being reliable equals the trust benefit they receive from the collective system.

Using the visit limit constraint $\\sum_{r\\in R:i\\in r}x_{r}\\leq k$, calculate the maximum possible reduction in routes if $k=2$ is imposed, assuming each split customer currently has 2-3 visits.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Current solution has 49 routes with some customers visited 2-3 times (from Table 3 characteristics).\n\nStep 2: With $k=2$, no customer can be visited more than twice. For customers currently visited 3 times, one visit must be eliminated.\n\nStep 3: Assuming $n$ customers are visited 3 times currently, eliminating one visit per such customer would reduce routes by $n$.\n\nStep 4: From Table 3's 'Max no. of split' column, the maximum visits is 2 for this instance, suggesting most splits are already at $k=2$. Thus, imposing $k=2$ may not reduce routes significantly - perhaps by 1-2 routes if any customers have 3 visits.\n\nStep 5: The 0.49% improvement comes from allowing some customers to have 2 visits instead of 1. Further restricting to $k=1$ (no splits) would likely increase total distance as more vehicles would be needed for customers with $d_i > Q/2$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the current increase in routes due to splits. The original routes were 21, and the heuristic increased this to 49. The difference is 28 extra routes from splits.\nStep 2: Model splits mathematically. Let S = total split customers, split into S2 (2 visits) and S3 (3 visits). Extra routes equation: S2 + 2S3 = 28.\nStep 3: For maximum reduction when k=2, minimize S (total split customers). Maximize S3 (since S3 contributes more to extra routes). Solve S2 + 2S3 = 28 with S2 = 0 gives S3 = 14 and S = 14.\nStep 4: After limiting to k=2, extra routes become S (14) instead of 28. New total routes = 21 + 14 = 35.

Since $\\{Y(x)\\}$ is SI-DCX, $g(x)$ is increasing and directionally convex in $x$ for any idcx $f$.\n\nStep 2: Since $\\{X(\\theta)\\}$ is SI-DCX, $E g(X(\\theta))$ is increasing and directionally convex in $\\theta$.\n\nStep 3: By the expectation formula, $E f(Y(X(\\theta))) = E g(X(\\theta))$. Thus, $E f(Y(X(\\theta)))$ is increasing and directionally convex in $\\theta$ for any idcx $f$, proving $\\{Y(X(\\theta))\\}$ is SI-DCX.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall that SI-DCX requires both stochastic increasingness (SI) and directional convexity (DCX) in the parameter. For the composition Y(X(θ)), we must verify both properties.\n\nStep 2: Show stochastic increasingness preservation. Since {X(θ)} is SI, θ₁ ≤ θ₂ ⇒ X(θ₁) ≤_{st} X(θ₂). As {Y(x)} is SI, x₁ ≤ x₂ ⇒ Y(x₁) ≤_{st} Y(x₂). Combining these gives Y(X(θ₁)) ≤_{st} Y(X(θ₂)) when θ₁ ≤ θ₂.\n\nStep 3: Analyze directional convexity using the expectation formula. For DCX, we need E[f(Y(X(θ)))] to be directionally convex in θ for any DCX function f. Expand using the given formula:\nE[f(Y(X(θ)))] = ∫_S [∫_T f(y)k(x,dy)] μ_θ(dx)\n\nStep 4: Recognize the inner integral ∫_T f(y)k(x,dy) = E[f(Y(x))] is DCX in x because {Y(x)} is SI-DCX. Let g(x) = E[f(Y(x))], which is DCX.\n\nStep 5: Since {X(θ)} is SI-DCX, θ ↦ E[g(X(θ))] = ∫_S g(x)μ_θ(dx) preserves DCX by the DCX property of {X(θ)}. Thus, θ ↦ E[f(Y(X(θ)))] is DCX.\n\nStep 6: Combine results.

The table shows that when n=8 and k=2.82, the R.H.S. of (37) is 1.05, which is very close to the target value 1.04.\nStep 2: Observe the trend in the table. Decreasing k from 2.84 (n=7) to 2.82 (n=8) decreases the R.H.S. from 3.769 to 1.05. Further decreasing k to 2.80 (n=9) results in a negative R.H.S. (-0.332).\nStep 3: Calculate the rate of change between n=7 and n=8 rows: ΔR.H.S./Δk = (1.05 - 3.769)/(2.82 - 2.84) ≈ 135.95 per unit k. This implies a decrease of ~0.01 in R.H.S. corresponds to a decrease of ~0.000074 in k.\nStep 4: Adjust k slightly from 2.82 to achieve R.H.S. = 1.04: k ≈ 2.82 - (1.05 - 1.04)/135.95 ≈ 2.8199.\nConclusion: The exact value of k for n=8 that satisfies the condition is approximately 2.8199, which rounds to 2.82 when considering practical precision from the table.\n\nQID: Management-table-781-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-781-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the trend in the table and performs accurate calculations to adjust the value of k to satisfy the condition.

The first two variables (PS and R) are preserved in both models, indicating some consistency in attribute importance. However, the order of the remaining variables differs, suggesting that while the models agree on the most critical attributes, there is variability in the secondary attributes.

The coefficient of determination ($r^2$) is calculated as $r^2 = (0.868)^2 = 0.753$.

Let $N_r$ be the number of ransom cases and $N_{nr}$ be the number of non-ransom cases. The frequency can be calculated as $F_r = \\frac{N_r}{N_r + N_{nr}}$ and $F_{nr} = \\frac{N_{nr}}{N_r + N_{nr}}$. Based on the table, we observe that the data is incomplete, but we can infer the presence of both categories.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the provided table structure.

How does this relate to Lemma 14's conclusion?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFrom $X_0 \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\{(z,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+m} \\mid \\|F_+(z,y)\\| \\leqslant \\alpha_0\\}$:\n1. If $F_+$ is Lipschitzianly invertible near $(z^*, y^*)$, there exists a neighborhood $U^*$ and $\\alpha_* > 0$ such that $F_+|_{U^*}: U^* \\to \\alpha_*\\mathbb{R}$ is bi-Lipschitz (Formula Context Block 8).\n2. Choose $\\alpha_0 \\leq \\alpha_*$; then $X_0 = F_+^{-1}(\\alpha_0 \\mathbb{B}) \\subset U^*$ (Formula Context Block 9). Since $U^*$ is bounded, $X_0$ is bounded.\n\nLemma 14 states that under (LI) and (SSOS), $X_0$ is bounded for some $\\alpha_0 > 0$. This aligns with the above derivation, as Lipschitz invertibility implies the existence of such $\\alpha_0$ via the bi-Lipschitz property.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall Formula Context\nFrom Formula Context Block 4, $X_0$ is likely defined through the generalized equation framework involving $F_+$. When $F_+$ is Lipschitzianly invertible near $(z^*, y^*)$, there exists a Lipschitz constant $L > 0$ and neighborhoods $V$, $U$ where $F_+^{-1}$ is Lipschitz continuous with modulus $L$.\n\nStep 2: Boundedness Condition\nFor $X_0$ to remain bounded, the residual term $\\|A_k - F'_+(z^*, y^*)\\|$ (first-order approximation error) must satisfy $\\|A_k - F'_+(z^*, y^*)\\| < \\frac{1}{L}$. This ensures the linearized problem inherits the stability of the original Lipschitzian invertibility, preventing divergence.\n\nStep 3: Connection to Lemma 14\nLemma 14 likely establishes global convergence under bounded iterates and controlled approximation errors. The derived condition aligns with Lemma 14's requirements by ensuring $X_0$ remains stable under perturbations, guaranteeing the damped Newton method avoids pathological divergence scenarios noted in computational results (e.g., Wright/Colville problems).\n\nQID: Management-table-440-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-440-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly focuses on residual terms and approximation errors, which are not relevant to the gold answer's derivation of boundedness via bi-Lipschitz properties and neighborhood containment.

If the nowcast error is $\\epsilon_n$ and forecast error at time $t$ is $\\epsilon_f e^{-\\lambda t}$, then SCEN3 is better when $\\epsilon_n < \\epsilon_f e^{-\\lambda t}$.

For $\\lambda = 0.1$, $\\epsilon_f = 2\\epsilon_n$, $t > 10 \\ln(2) \\approx 6.93$ time units.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Define utility metrics for scenarios. Let utility for SCEN3 (nowcast) remain constant at 1 (no decay). SCEN4 (forecast) utility decays as \\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\nStep 2: Integrate utilities over voyage duration \\( T \\). SCEN3 total utility = \\( \\int_0^T 1 \\, dt = T \\).

Assume the elasticity difference represents the incremental effectiveness of JA over DM. How does the cost-effectiveness ratio evolve over time?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract the expenditure data from Table 1. For JA: $1.209, for DM: $1.630. Step 2: Extract the elasticity differences from Table 2. For JA-DM, SR: 0.144, Q: 0.167, LR: 0.347. Step 3: Calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio as $\\frac{\\Delta_{JA-DM}}{\\text{Expenditure Difference}}$. The expenditure difference is $1.630 - 1.209 = 0.421$. Step 4: Compute the ratios: SR: $\\frac{0.144}{0.421} \\approx 0.342$, Q: $\\frac{0.167}{0.421} \\approx 0.397$, LR: $\\frac{0.347}{0.421} \\approx 0.824$. The cost-effectiveness of JA over DM increases over time, with the largest gain in the long-run.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify expenditures from Table 1:\n- Journal Advertising (JA): $1.209\n- Direct Mail (DM): $1.630\n\nStep 2: Define cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) formula:\nCER = Cost / Effectiveness\n\nStep 3: Assume elasticity difference (Δ = η_JA - η_DM) from Table 2 represents incremental effectiveness of JA over DM. Let Δ_SR, Δ_Q, Δ_LR denote these values for short-run, quarterly, and long-run.\n\nStep 4: Calculate CER for JA in each period:\nCER_JA = $1.209 / Δ\n\nStep 5: Calculate CER for DM in each period. Since DM's effectiveness is η_DM = η_JA - Δ, substitute Δ into DM's CER formula:\nCER_DM = $1.630 / (η_JA - Δ) = $1.630 / (Δ + η_DM - η_DM) → Requires η_JA or η_DM values (missing). Assuming DM’s CER is inversely related to Δ, higher Δ reduces JA’s CER but increases DM’s CER.\n\nStep 6: Evolution over time:\n- If Δ increases (e.g., LR > Q > SR), JA’s CER decreases (more cost-effective), while DM’s CER increases (less cost-effective).\n- Example: If Δ_SR = 0.2, Δ_Q = 0.5, Δ_LR = 0.8:\n  - CER_JA_SR = $1.209/0.2 = $6.045\n  - CER_JA_LR = $1.209/0.8 = $1.511\n\nConclusion: JA becomes increasingly cost-effective over time as its incremental effectiveness (Δ) grows, while DM’s cost-effectiveness diminishes relative to JA.\n\nQID: Management-table-696-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-696-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the expenditures and the concept of cost-effectiveness ratio but incorrectly applies the formula (Cost/Effectiveness instead of Effectiveness/Cost Difference).

If $\\hat{E}$ is valid, $E-\\hat{E}$ contains a minimum $r$-cut $C$. The characteristic vector of $C$ is in the core because it satisfies $z(e)=0$ for $e\\in\\hat{E}$ and $z(S)\\geq v(S)$ for all $S\\subseteq E$. Conversely, if the core is nonempty, there exists a $z$ in the core, and by Claim 1, $E_{z}^{+}$ contains a minimum $r$-cut, implying $\\hat{E}$ is valid.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall the fundamental theorem for core existence in combinatorial games. For maximum games like the r-arborescence game, the core is nonempty iff the primal LP has integer optimal solutions, which occurs when the polyhedron is integral.\n\nStep 2: Understand dummy players (edges) in this context as elements that never appear in any minimum r-cut. Their removal (E-Ê) must preserve the essential game structure.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that minimum r-cuts correspond to the tight constraints in the dual LP. For the core to exist, these constraints must remain intact after removing dummy edges.\n\nStep 4: ⇒ (If E-Ê contains a minimum r-cut): This guarantees the primal LP's integrality is preserved. The remaining edges contain critical constraints needed for core allocations through dual optimal solutions.\n\nStep 5: ⇐ (Core nonempty implies E-Ê contains min r-cut): If no minimum r-cut remained in E-Ê, all critical constraints would involve dummy edges. This would violate the complementary slackness conditions required for core allocations, making the core empty.\n\nStep 6: Connect to Edmonds' theorem on disjoint arborescences - the integrality condition for the primal LP corresponds to the matroidal structure preserved exactly when essential cuts are maintained in E-Ê.\n\nQID: Management-table-642-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-642-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the conditions for the core's non-emptiness but uses different reasoning (LP integrality, Edmonds' theorem) than the gold answer's direct appeal to Theorem 4 and Claim 1.

The point where utilization exceeds 90% is when cumulative usage > 2160 (90% of 2400). From Table 4, this occurs at step 23 (X22) with cumulative usage of 2160. Adding projects beyond this point risks over-utilization, leading to resource shortages. The trade-off is between maximizing portfolio value and maintaining resource feasibility. Projects added after this point must be carefully evaluated for their marginal contribution versus resource demand.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify that the question requires analyzing Resource Type 1's utilization efficiency during sequential project addition.

Suppose the mediator recommends action $a_{2}$ to player 1 and $b_{1}$ to player 2, yielding (7,2). If player 1 deviates to $a_{1}$, the payoff becomes (6,6). The expected payoff under deviation is $6 > 7$ when averaged over time, violating the inequality: $$\\operatorname*{limsup}_{T}E_{\\bar{\\sigma},\\tau,\\rho}\\bigg[(1/T)\\sum_{t=1}^{T}x_{1}^{t}\\bigg] = 6 \\nleq 7 = H_{1}^{*}(\\sigma,\\tau).$$ Thus, (7,2) cannot be sustained as an upper correlated equilibrium payoff.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the payoff (7,2) in the table. This occurs at action profile (a2, b1).\n\nStep 2: Recall the upper correlated equilibrium condition: For player 1, the limsup of the average expected payoff under any strategy must satisfy $$\\operatorname*{limsup}_{T}E_{\\bar{\\sigma},\\tau,\\rho}\\left[\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}x_{1}^{t}\\right] \\leq H_{1}^{*}(\\sigma,\\tau)$$ for all possible deviations $\\bar{\\sigma}$.\n\nStep 3: Determine $H_{1}^{*}(\\sigma,\\tau)$. This represents the maximum payoff player 1 can guarantee regardless of player 2's responses. Player 2 can minimize player 1's maximum payoff by avoiding b1 (since (a2, b1) gives 7).

Then, we categorize them based on their titles: 'Business Analytics', 'Analytics', or other variations. The proportion is calculated as the number of programs in each category divided by the total number of programs. For example, if there are $N_{BA}$ programs with 'Business Analytics' and $N_{total}$ total programs, the proportion is $\\frac{N_{BA}}{N_{total}}$. This proportion can be compared to the industry demand for 'Business Analytics' versus 'Analytics' skills to assess alignment.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract all program titles from the table. The table contains 49 entries, but after removing duplicates and blank entries, there are 46 valid programs.\n\nStep 2: Categorize programs into two groups:\n- 'Business Analytics': Titles explicitly including \"Business Analytics\" (e.g., Brandeis University).\n- 'Analytics/Variations': Titles with \"Analytics\" but not \"Business Analytics\" (e.g., \"Data Analytics\", \"Applied Analytics\").\n\nStep 3: Count programs in each category:\n- 'Business Analytics': 26 programs (56.5% of total).\n- 'Analytics/Variations': 20 programs (43.5% of total).\n\nStep 4: Analyze alignment with industry demand. A majority (56.5%) use \"Business Analytics,\" suggesting alignment with industry emphasis on business-focused analytics skills. However, 43.5% use broader terms like \"Analytics,\" which may reflect either misalignment (if industry prioritizes business context) or diversification (if industry values varied specializations like data or decision analytics).

Use the optimality conditions from Lemma 1 to justify your reasoning.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe transition between linear segments in $\\mathbf{x}(\\lambda)$ occurs when the marginal cost of routing flow changes due to either (1) a change in the active piece of a piecewise quadratic cost function $F_e(x)$, or (2) a capacity constraint (lower or upper) becomes active or inactive. At each breakpoint $\\lambda_i$, the following conditions must hold:\n\n1. **Optimality Conditions**: For all edges $e \\in E$, the reduced cost must satisfy $c_e^\\pi(\\lambda_i) = F_e'(x_e(\\lambda_i)) + \\pi_{u} - \\pi_{v} \\geq 0$ (for forward edges) or $\\leq 0$ (for backward edges), where $\\pi$ is the vertex potential.\n\n2. **Flow Conservation**: The flow $\\mathbf{x}(\\lambda_i)$ must satisfy $\\sum_{e \\in \\delta^+(v)} x_e(\\lambda_i) - \\sum_{e \\in \\delta^-(v)} x_e(\\lambda_i) = \\lambda_i q_v$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\n3. **Capacity Constraints**: For each edge $e$, either $x_e(\\lambda_i) = l_e$, $x_e(\\lambda_i) = u_e$, or $l_e < x_e(\\lambda_i) < u_e$.\n\nWhen any of these conditions change (e.g., $x_e(\\lambda_i)$ hits a capacity or $F_e'$ changes due to a breakpoint in $F_e$), a new linear segment begins. The coefficients $\\alpha_{e,i}, \\beta_{e,i}$ are recalculated to maintain optimality for $\\lambda \\in [\\lambda_i, \\lambda_{i+1}]$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall that parametric mincost flow solutions must satisfy strict complementary slackness, flow conservation (div(x(λ)) = λq), and capacity constraints l_e ≤ x_e(λ) ≤ u_e at all λ.\n\nStep 2: Optimality requires marginal costs F'_e(x_e(λ)) to equal potential differences between nodes. Since F_e are piecewise quadratic, their derivatives F'_e are piecewise linear functions of x_e.\n\nStep 3: Transitions occur when either:\n   a) Capacity event: x_e(λ) reaches l_e or u_e for some edge e, forcing a structural change in active constraints.\n   b) Marginal cost switching event: x_e(λ) crosses a breakpoint in F'_e(x_e), causing F'_e to switch linear segments. This alters the potential balance requirements, necessitating a new affine flow regime.\n\nStep 4: At these λ_i values, the system can no longer maintain continuity of derivatives in the KKT conditions (Lemma 1).

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-62-3", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nBased on Table 4, analyze why $Z_{t}$ ranks highest for successful conversions and lowest for conversion failures.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\n$Z_{t}$ ranks highest for successful conversions because it provides the lowest RIV value, setting a low threshold for RIK to outperform. This strong evidence supports conversion. For failures, $Z_{t}$ ranks lowest because it provides the highest RIV value, making it less supportive of conversion. This dual behavior shows $Z_{t}$'s sensitivity to market conditions and its effectiveness in distinguishing successful from unsuccessful conversions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand Zₜ's formula. When the monthly NYMEX price change exceeds 12%, Zₜ = NYMEXₜ - 15.5% × (NYMEXₜ - NYMEXₜ₊₁). Otherwise, it uses the Henry Hub daily average price. Step 2: Analyze successful conversions (gains). When price volatility is low (<12%), Zₜ uses the daily average (Henry Hub), which often aligns better with market realities. For example, in Jul-01 (Zₜ = 3.074), the net price exceeded the goal, yielding a $233k gain. This stable scenario allows accurate goal-setting. Step 3: Examine conversion failures (losses). During high volatility (>12%), Zₜ uses the adjusted NYMEX formula. In Oct-01, Zₜ = 2.043 (adjusted for a 75% NYMEX increase), but the net price dropped to 1.422, causing a $354k loss. The formula’s adjustment overcompensated for volatility, misaligning with actual prices. Step 4: Conclusion. Zₜ ranks highest for successes because stable periods (using daily averages) lead to achievable goals. It ranks lowest for failures because volatility adjustments create mismatches between Zₜ and market outcomes.\n\nQID: Management-table-62-3\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-62-3\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains why $Z_{t}$ ranks highest for successful conversions and lowest for failures, aligning with the gold answer's reasoning about RIV values and market conditions.

Suppose a simulation model’s profit function is $P(x) = 50x - 0.5x^2$, where $x$ is the number of resources. Using OptQuest, find the optimal $x$ that maximizes $P(x)$. What stopping criteria would you use for the optimization?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The theoretical maximum occurs where $\\frac{dP}{dx} = 0$. $50 - x = 0 \\implies x = 50$. Step 2: In OptQuest, set the objective to maximize $P(x)$ and constrain $x \\geq 0$. Use stopping criteria: (a) maximum iterations (e.g., 100), (b) relative improvement threshold (e.g., $<0.1\\%$ change in $P(x)$ over 10 iterations), or (c) computation time limit.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the optimization goal. The profit function $P(x) = 50x - 0.5x^2$ is a concave quadratic function, which has a unique maximum. Mathematically, the maximum occurs at $x = 50$ (found by solving $P'(x) = 50 - x = 0$).

Still, typical stopping criteria include:\n- **Maximum iterations**: Limit the number of simulation runs (e.g., 100 iterations).\n- **Convergence threshold**: Stop when the improvement in profit is < 1% over 10 consecutive iterations.\n- **Time limit**: Set a runtime limit (e.g., 5 minutes) if computational resources are constrained.\n- **Absolute tolerance**: Stop when the difference between the best and worst solutions in the population is negligible (e.g., $\\Delta P(x) < 0.1$).\n\nStep 3: Justify criteria.

Assume a normal distribution for the scores.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the probability, we first identify the relevant row in Table 3 where Orders/Day is '5 to 10' and Avail Chassis is '0to5'. The average score is 0.80 with a standard deviation of 0.04. Assuming a normal distribution, the probability $P$ of selecting a leased chassis is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution at the average score.

These conditions ensure that the constraint matrix $H$ is totally unimodular, which guarantees that all vertices of the feasible region are integral when $h$ is integral. This property is significant in matroid theory as it generalizes the max-flow min-cut theorem from graph theory to matroids, ensuring the existence of integral solutions for flow problems on such matroids.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that integral optimal solutions in linear programs often arise from totally unimodular (TU) constraint matrices. For matroid-based LPs like P(M,l,h), this requires analyzing the structure of matrix H derived from matroid M.\n\nStep 2: Note that regular matroids (matroids representable by TU matrices over all fields) guarantee TU properties in their derived constraint matrix H. Regularity is equivalent to being representable over ℝ with a TU matrix.\n\nStep 3: The condition for P(M,l,h) to have an integral optimal solution is that matroid M must be regular (i.e., representable by a TU matrix) and vector h must be integral. TU ensures all basic feasible solutions are integral when h is integral.\n\nStep 4: In matroid theory, this aligns with the duality between combinatorial structure and LP relaxations. Regular matroids generalize graphical matroids (e.g., spanning tree problems with natural integral solutions), allowing LPs to preserve integrality without explicit integer constraints.

For a given baseline (p₀, μ₀):\nΔp = (Δp%/100) × p₀,\nΔμ = (Δμ%/100) × μ₀.\n\nStep 4: Substitute into Δp = bΔμ:\nb = [(Δp%/100) × p₀] / [(Δμ%/100) × μ₀] = (Δp% × p₀) / (Δμ% × μ₀).\n\nStep 5: Use baseline price p₀ = a + bμ₀.

At a Riemannian FOSP $[\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V}]$, we have $\\overline{{\\mathrm{grad} h_{r}([\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V}])}} = 0$ and $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{V}^{\\top})\\mathbf{V} = 0$, $\\mathbf{U}^{\\top}\\nabla f(\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{V}^{\\top}) = 0$.\n\n2.

This mapping preserves the Riemannian structure through horizontal lifting.\n\nStep 2: The Riemannian Hessian on $\\mathcal{M}_r^{q_2}$ is defined as the projection of the covariant derivative of the Riemannian gradient onto the horizontal space. By invariance of $h_r([\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V}]) = f(\\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{V}^\top)$ under equivalence classes, vertical components vanish in the quotient geometry.\n\nStep 3: Using the bijectivity of $\\mathcal{L}^{r}_{\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V}}$, the horizontal lift of $\theta_{(\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V})}$ corresponds to $\\mathcal{L}^{r}_{\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{V}}(\theta)$ in $T_{\\mathbf{X}}\\mathcal{M}_r^e$.

For example, if Group A and Group B have utility scores $U_A$ and $U_B$, the Pearson correlation is $r_{AB} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(U_A, U_B)}{\\sigma_{U_A} \\sigma_{U_B}}$.

To validate similarity of winning sets, we can use the Jaccard similarity index: $J(S_A, S_B) = \\frac{|S_A \\cap S_B|}{|S_A \\cup S_B|}$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the winning sets for Groups A and B. A value close to 1 indicates high similarity.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: To assess consensus among executive groups using the compensatory model $U_i = \\sum w_j x_{ij}$, calculate the variability in attribute weights ($w_j$) across groups.

This compares overlap in selections (intersection/union of sets).\n\nStep 3: Statistically validate results using Cohen’s Kappa or Fleiss’ Kappa to measure agreement beyond chance. For example, Fleiss’ Kappa is suitable for multiple groups and categorical outcomes (e.g., 'selected' vs. 'not selected').\n\nStep 4: If needed, perform permutation tests to confirm observed similarities are statistically significant (e.g., comparing observed Jaccard values to random chance distributions).\n\nQID: Management-table-748-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-748-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer partially aligns with the gold answer by correctly suggesting the Jaccard Similarity Index for winning sets.

For $f(x) = x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 - x_1^2x_2^2 - x_2^2x_3^2 - x_3^2x_1^2$, we first verify that $f$ is positive definite: $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$ (e.g., by checking on the unit sphere).

Testing for SOS decomposition at $k=1$ (e.g., using SDP) may fail, but empirical results suggest $k=2$ suffices, yielding a degree-8 polynomial. The minimal $k$ can be found by incrementally testing higher values until the SDP solver confirms an SOS decomposition.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Verify Positive Definiteness\nFirst, we check if $f(x) = x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 - x_1^2x_2^2 - x_2^2x_3^2 - x_3^2x_1^2$ is positive definite.

Provide a step-by-step calculation using the frequency data.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFrom Table 2, the total number of firms is 495. The number of firms that have adopted MS/OR in at least one area (ORAI ≥ 1) is 132 (ORAI=1) + 36 (ORAI=2) + 115 (ORAI=3) = 283. The probability $P$ is calculated as $P = \\frac{283}{495} \\approx 0.5717$ or 57.17%. This means there is a 57.17% chance that a randomly selected firm has adopted MS/OR in at least one functional area.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relevant variable for MS/OR adoption. Table 2 shows '7. Application areas' (FUNCAREAS) with a range of 0-11, indicating this variable counts adopted functional areas.<br />Step 2: The question requires the probability that FUNCAREAS ≥1. This equals 1 minus the proportion of firms with FUNCAREAS = 0.<br />Step 3: Table 2 provides the mean FUNCAREAS (6.8) but not explicit frequency counts. To estimate, assume all firms have either 0 or the mean value (sincere approximation): Let N = total firms. Total application areas = 6.8N. If x firms have 0, then (N−x) firms contribute 6.8N total areas. This leads to an undefined system without additional constraints.<br />Step 4: Since data is insufficient for exact calculation, acknowledge the limitation: The table lacks frequency counts for firms with 0 vs. ≥1 areas.

This ensures that the quantity of each sorted component used in a recipe is proportional to the recipe's requirements.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify relevant parameters and decision variables. From Table B.3, recipes (R) require specific quantities of sorted components (S). Table B.2 likely contains decision variables representing component flows (e.g., x_{s,r} = quantity of sorted component s used in recipe r).\n\nStep 2: Define recipe proportionality. Each recipe r ∈ R has parameters (e.g., α_{s,r}) from Table B.3 specifying the required quantity of sorted component s per unit output.\n\nStep 3: Formulate material balance. For each recipe r, the total input of each sorted component s must match the recipe’s requirement: ∑_{s ∈ S} α_{s,r} ⋅ x_{s,r} = Output_r, where Output_r is the recipe’s production quantity (a decision variable).\n\nStep 4: Link to assembly components.

Interpret the result.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe lead time elasticity of the batch size measures the percentage change in lead time relative to the percentage change in demand. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Initial and Final Values**:\n   - Initial lead time $L_1 = 51$ days.\n   - Final lead time $L_2 = 30$ days.\n   - Initial demand $D_1 = 12$ units/month.\n   - Final demand $D_2 = 12$ units/month (no change).\n\n2. **Percentage Changes**:\n   - Since demand does not change ($D_1 = D_2$), the percentage change in demand is $0\\%$.\n   - The percentage change in lead time is $\\frac{L_2 - L_1}{L_1} \\times 100 = \\frac{30 - 51}{51} \\times 100 = -41.18\\%$.\n\n3. **Elasticity Calculation**:\n   - Elasticity $E = \\frac{\\% \\Delta L}{\\% \\Delta D} = \\frac{-41.18}{0}$.\n   - Since the denominator is zero, the elasticity is undefined.\n\n4. **Interpretation**:\n   - The result indicates that the lead time is highly sensitive to factors other than demand, as it changes significantly even when demand remains constant.

This suggests:\n1. The batch size decision is decoupled from demand in this scenario\n2. Lead time improvements likely stem from operational efficiencies rather than demand changes\n3.

For $n \\geq 4$, the protocol ensures that any unilateral deviation is detected, and the expected payoffs remain consistent with the correlated equilibrium.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify Correlated Equilibrium Requirements\n\nFor a correlated equilibrium, players must have no incentive to unilaterally deviate from recommended strategies. Given the distribution $p$ where players always coordinate (heads/heads or tails/tails with 50% probability each), players must believe that conditional on their own action recommendation, the other player(s) will follow the correlated strategy.\n\nStep 2: Interpret the Table as a Coordination Game\nThe distribution implies perfect correlation: Players match actions deterministically (HH or TT). This requires a mechanism to enforce coordination without centralized mediation.\n\nStep 3: Apply Barany's Theorem Conditions\nImre Barany showed that for $n \\geq 4$ players, any correlated equilibrium can be implemented without a mediator via a finite protocol. Key conditions are:\n1) Common knowledge of rationality,\n2) Public communication channels,\n3) Ability to execute \"jointly controlled lotteries\" (public randomization devices) to simulate the correlation.\n\nStep 4: Link to Formula Context\nUsing the $(X, E)$ model, the players must partition the event space $E$ such that $|E \\cap X_a|/L = p(a)$ holds for all $a \\in A$. For $n \\geq 4$, players can use pairwise agreements to replicate the $p(a)$ distribution through combinatorial strategies, ensuring:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Number of HH configurations}}{L} = \\frac{1}{2},\\quad \\frac{\\text{Number of TT configurations}}{L} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nStep 5: Verify Equilibrium Stability\nPlayers observe that unilateral deviations break the symmetric coordination structure. With $n \\geq 4$, a quorum of players can enforce compliance through majority voting or redundancy, satisfying the expected payoff inequality in the formula context.\n\nConclusion: The conditions are met when $n \\geq 4$, players use public communication to implement jointly controlled lotteries, and the symmetric $p(a)$ distribution is preserved through combinatorial partitioning of the strategy space.\n\nQID: Management-table-412-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-412-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately addresses the conditions for achieving a correlated equilibrium without a mediator for $n \\\\geq 4$ players, aligning with the gold answer.

Show the step-by-step calculation of expected payoffs for both players.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we first identify the best response for each player given the other's strategy. For the defender, the best response to an attacker targeting Target 1 is the patrol schedule with the highest defender payoff (100 in row 2). For the attacker, the best response to the defender's strategy in row 2 is to target the area with the highest attacker payoff (Target 4 with 20). However, in row 2, the attacker's payoff for Target 4 is -20, so the attacker would not choose Target 4. Instead, the attacker would choose Target 1, which gives them -100, but this is the least worst option. This suggests that row 2 is not a Nash equilibrium. We must check all combinations to find where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy. After evaluating all combinations, the Nash equilibrium occurs when the defender chooses the patrol schedule in row 4 and the attacker chooses Target 4, with payoffs (10, -10).

The cycle contains at least one edge from $F$ (where $L_{e}^{j}(f)\\neq L_{e}^{j}(g)$).\n2. For each edge $e$ in the cycle from $F$, either $\\vec{h}_{e}=0$ or $\\vec{h}_{e}$ has the same orientation as $\\vec{h}_{e}^{j}$.\n\nExamining Table 3, we see that for player $b$, the circulation differences are positive on edges $e1, e2, e4, e5$ and negative on $e6$. For player $r$, they are negative on $e1, e3, e5$ and positive on $e6$. There is no cycle in the graph where all edges satisfy condition (2) for either player, thus no agreeing cycle exists.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the definitions. A circulation difference $g-f$ must satisfy flow conservation (zero net flow at all nodes). An agreeing cycle is a directed cycle where all edges have strictly positive flow in both $g$ and $f$ (or strictly negative in both), implying the circulation difference $g-f$ maintains uniform directionality along the cycle.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the network structure. From Table 3’s edge labels (e1-e6), the graph likely forms a cyclic structure (e.g., parallel edges e1/e5 and e2/e4 interconnected with e3/e6). The latency functions’ piecewise nature creates distinct equilibrium regions.\n\nStep 3: Use equilibrium conditions. At equilibrium, marginal delays on all used paths between the same OD pair must be equal. For two distinct equilibria $f$ and $g$, flow differences $g-f$ correspond to a circulation where latency function derivatives and player-specific flow allocations prevent uniform directional alignment.\n\nStep 4: Assume for contradiction there exists an agreeing cycle $C$ in $g-f$. This would imply all edges in $C$ have $g_e > f_e$ (or $g_e < f_e$) uniformly. However, the piecewise latency functions in Table 3 (e.g., e1/e5 and e6 switching at certain flow thresholds) enforce conflicting marginal cost adjustments along any potential cycle, violating the equilibrium inequalities. Thus, no such $C$ can exist.\n\nQID: Management-table-492-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-492-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT_BUT_REASONING_MISMATCH\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly concludes that no agreeing cycle exists, but the reasoning differs from the gold answer.

By Theorem 5.6, weak vertex-decomposability implies a polynomial upper bound on the diameter function $\\Delta$. Specifically, the diameter $\\Delta$ of the complex is bounded by $2(n-s-1)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. This follows from the fact that weak vertex-decomposability allows for a shedding order of vertices, which in turn ensures that the ridge-path between any two facets has a length polynomial in $n$. The bound $2(n-s-1)$ is derived from the maximum number of steps required to construct the ridge-path under the given conditions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Observe that the inclusion chain 𝔇(s,s) ⊃ ⋯ ⊃ 𝔇(s,0) implies each class 𝔇(s,k) requires k+1 decomposition steps.

The higher savings indicate more efficient routes, as they represent greater reductions in distance. Thus, prioritizing these links in route formation would maximize overall savings.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the Savings Matrix structure. The table shows city-to-city savings values in columns labeled C; to C6, with rows representing origin cities. The first two numeric columns (33, 37, etc.) likely represent terminal distances, while subsequent numbers represent calculated savings from equation (8).\n\nStep 2: Identify maximum savings value. The highest numerical value in the savings columns is 65 (found in the C6 row under the C5 column).\n\nStep 3: Determine terminal association. The formula context shows savings depend on terminal choice ($k$). While the table doesn't explicitly state terminals, maximum savings would occur where $\\tilde{d}_i^k + \\tilde{d}_j^k$ is maximized relative to $d_{i,j}$. The 65 value implies significant combined terminal distances outweighing the inter-city distance.\n\nStep 4: Implications for routing.

For any edge $\\{(a, b), (b, d)\\}$ in $G_I'$, the function $f$ maps $(a, b)$ and $(b, d)$ to vertices in $G'$ such that $\\{f((a, b)), f((b, d))\\}$ is an edge in $G'$. For example, if $(a, b) = (s_i, s_j)$ and $(b, d) = (s_j, s_k)$, then $f((s_i, s_j)) = v_j$ and $f((s_j, s_k)) = v_k$, and $\\{v_j, v_k\\}$ is an edge in $G'$ because $v_j$ is the parent of $v_k$ in $T$. Similar reasoning applies to other cases, ensuring $f$ preserves adjacency and thus defines an isomorphism.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the components. The subgraph G_I' is induced by vertex subset D (job pairs), forming edges between these pairs. Function f maps each job pair in D to unique vertices in G' (v_j, u1^i, u2^i, e1^{ij}, e2^{ij}).\n\nStep 2: Verify bijection. The function f is injective because distinct job pair types map to distinct vertices in G', and surjective because all G' vertices are covered by f's cases.\n\nStep 3: Preserve adjacency. Two job pairs (a,b) and (c,d) in D share an endpoint in the original graph iff their images f(a,b) and f(c,d) are connected in G'. For example:\n- (s_i, m_i) → u1^i and (m_i, e_i) → u2^i share m_i → u1^i connects to u2^i in G'.\n- (s_i, b_{ij}) → e1^{ij} and (b_{ij}, m_j) → e2^{ij} share b_{ij} → e1^{ij} connects to e2^{ij} in G'.\n\nStep 4: Confirm isomorphic structure. Since f maintains vertex correspondences and edge adjacencies between G_I' and G', the graphs are structurally identical under this mapping.\n\nConclusion: f establishes a bijective correspondence between D's induced subgraph G_I' and G' while preserving adjacency, proving isomorphism.\n\nQID: Management-table-625-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-625-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains the bijection and adjacency preservation, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the isomorphism between G_I' and G'.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-625-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the bijection and adjacency preservation, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the isomorphism between G_I' and G'."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-625-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the bijection and adjacency preservation, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion about the isomorphism between G_I' and G'."}

Thus, $\\epsilon_{TC} = \\frac{-0.55}{20} = -0.0275$, indicating inelastic response of total cost to exploitation factor.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify that Table 3 (not shown in the provided data) likely contains cost values for different EF levels based on the consolidation strategy.

However, none of the provided tables include numerical EF values or cost figures needed for this calculation.\n\nStep 3: Note that under the described MILP framework in Formula Context, EF would likely be a discrete parameter (Normal/High). This would require cost data at both EF levels for medium biorefineries using consolidation strategies.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that insufficient data is provided in the given materials (only institutional collaborators listed) to perform the calculation - likely requiring access to the original study's Table 3 with EF-linked cost values for different biorefinery configurations.\n\nQID: Management-table-308-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-308-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INVALID_QUESTION\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The gold answer itself indicates the question is unanswerable or flawed due to missing context, as it references a Table 3 that is not provided.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-308-2", "category": "INVALID_QUESTION", "explanation": "The gold answer itself indicates the question is unanswerable or flawed due to missing context, as it references a Table 3 that is not provided."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-308-2", "llm_grader_category": "INVALID_QUESTION", "llm_grader_explanation": "The gold answer itself indicates the question is unanswerable or flawed due to missing context, as it references a Table 3 that is not provided."}

Using queueing theory, estimate the expected waiting time if the utilization were reduced to 80%, assuming an M/M/1 queue model with service rate $\\mu$ and arrival rate $\\lambda$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: For an M/M/1 queue, the average waiting time ($W_q$) is given by $W_q = \\frac{\\rho}{\\mu(1-\\rho)}$, where $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$ is the utilization. Step 2: In Case 6, $\\rho = 0.99$ and $W_q = 0.46 \\cdot W$, where $W$ is the total throughput time (130 days).

The error decreases superlinearly. Using the inequality $\\|v_{n+1}-v^{*}\\|\\leqslant L\\|v_{n}-v^{*}\\|^{1+p}$, we can estimate $L$ and $p$ by fitting the error reduction pattern.

For $f_j(x_j) = a_jx_j + b_jx_j^2$ with domain $0 \\leq x_j \\leq c_j$, the conjugate $g_j(t_j) = \\sup_{x_j \\in [0,c_j]} \\{ t_jx_j - a_jx_j - b_jx_j^2 \\}$.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the expression inside the supremum: $t_jx_j - a_jx_j - b_jx_j^2 = x_j(t_j - a_j) - b_jx_j^2$. This is a concave quadratic function in $x_j$ with maximum at critical point $x_j^* = \\frac{t_j - a_j}{2b_j}$.\n\nStep 3: Analyze three cases based on $x_j^*$'s position relative to $[0,c_j]$:\n- If $\\frac{t_j - a_j}{2b_j} \\leq 0$ (i.e., $t_j \\leq a_j$), maximum occurs at $x_j = 0$: $g_j(t_j) = 0$.\n- If $0 < \\frac{t_j - a_j}{2b_j} < c_j$ (i.e., $a_j < t_j < a_j + 2b_jc_j$), maximum occurs at $x_j^*$: $g_j(t_j) = \\frac{(t_j - a_j)^2}{4b_j}$.\n- If $\\frac{t_j - a_j}{2b_j} \\geq c_j$ (i.e., $t_j \\geq a_j + 2b_jc_j$), maximum occurs at $x_j = c_j$: $g_j(t_j) = c_j(t_j - a_j) - b_jc_j^2$.\n\nStep 4: Verify convexity of $g_j(t_j)$. All three pieces are convex (constant, quadratic with positive coefficient, linear), and continuity at boundaries $t_j = a_j$ and $t_j = a_j + 2b_jc_j$ ensures overall convexity.\n\nStep 5: Analyze differentiability. The function is smooth at boundaries ($\\frac{(t_j - a_j)}{2b_j}$ matches $0$ at $t_j=a_j$ and $c_j$ at $t_j=a_j + 2b_jc_j$), making $g_j$ differentiable everywhere. The derivative transitions smoothly from $0$ to $(t_j - a_j)/2b_j$ to $c_j$.\n\nStep 6: Connect to ε-compliance. The middle case corresponds to $t_j = f_j'(x_j) = a_j + 2b_jx_j$ (characteristic curve $\\Gamma_j$), while boundary cases correspond to primal variable $x_j$ at domain limits.

For example, the loss-cost at the base point is $\\$756.66$.\n3. **Local Exploration**: Perform a local exploration around the initial point with a step size of $0.10$ for $h$ and $s$. Identify the point with the lowest loss-cost (e.g., $h=2.1$, $s=0.6$ with $c=\\$594.44$).\n4. **Pattern Search**: Extend the pattern from the initial point to the new base point and perform further explorations. For instance, extend to $h=2.2$, $s=0.7$ and compute $c$.\n5. **Iteration**: Repeat the pattern search until the step size reduces to a specified value or the number of iterations reaches a limit.

The headway constraint (2c) extends the occupancy of train $r$ to blocks $i+1$ and $i+2$ due to $h = 2$.\n2.

How does the 35% increase in total trips compared to the estimation phase affect these values?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total number of trips for each model, we use the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{Total Trips} = \\frac{\\text{Total Vehicle Kilometers}}{\\text{Mean Trip Length}} \\]\n\nFor the traditional model: \n\\[ \\frac{2.57 \\times 10^6}{22.5} \\approx 114,222 \\text{ trips} \\]\n\nFor the reverse model: \n\\[ \\frac{2.71 \\times 10^6}{21.7} \\approx 124,885 \\text{ trips} \\]\n\nFor the simultaneous model: \n\\[ \\frac{2.84 \\times 10^6}{23.3} \\approx 121,888 \\text{ trips} \\]\n\nGiven a 35% increase in total trips compared to the estimation phase, the original number of trips can be estimated by dividing the calculated trips by 1.35.

Assume ranks are uniformly distributed.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: For a single expert, the rank of an objective is uniformly distributed between 1 and 10, so $E[r_{ij}] = \\frac{1+10}{2} = 5.5$.\nStep 2: For five experts, the expected total rank for any objective is $E[P(s_i)] = 5 \\times 5.5 = 27.5$.\nStep 3: The minimum total rank is the first order statistic for 10 i.i.d. variables. The expected value is approximated by $E[P_{(1)}] \\approx \\mu - \\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\ln n}$, where $\\mu = 27.5$, $\\sigma^2 = 5 \\times \\frac{(10^2 - 1)}{12} = 41.25$, and $n=10$.\nStep 4: Compute $E[P_{(1)}] \\approx 27.5 - \\sqrt{41.25} \\times \\sqrt{2 \\ln 10} \\approx 27.5 - 6.42 \\times 2.15 \\approx 13.7$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand that five experts each rank 10 objectives uniformly (1-10). Each objective's total score is the sum of its ranks across experts.\n\nStep 2: Treat each expert's ranking as independent uniform variables (problem specifies uniform distribution). Each total score S~i follows the distribution of the sum of five independent uniform(1-10) variables.\n\nStep 3: Calculate mean and variance for individual scores:\n  • Mean per expert rank = (1+10)/2 = 5.5\n  • Total mean μ = 5×5.5 = 27.5\n  • Variance per expert rank = (10²−1)/12 = 8.25\n  • Total variance σ² = 5×8.25 = 41.25 ⇒ σ ≈6.42\n\nStep 4: Use extreme value theory for normal distributions.

If treated as numerical, we can compute statistical measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation. For example, if '8d' is treated as 8 and '13' as 13, the mean is $\\mu = \\frac{8 + 13}{2} = 10.5$, variance $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(8-10.5)^2 + (13-10.5)^2}{2} = 6.25$, and standard deviation $\\sigma = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5$. If treated as categorical, we can compute frequency counts and mode.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the table structure and context. The table appears in a book review dataset context but contains fragmented symbols (α, ∈x, 8d, 13, etc.) likely due to formatting/rendering errors. Numerical values like '8d' and '13' are ambiguous without column headers.\n\nStep 2: Interpret plausible meanings. In book review datasets, numbers might represent:\n- Page counts (e.g., '13' could indicate 13 pages)\n- Time metrics (e.g., '8d' might mean 8 days to review)\n- Book IDs or codes (if alphanumeric)\n- Review counts (e.g., 13 reviews received)\n\nStep 3: Address alphanumerics. The 'd' in '8d' could denote:\n- Days (time unit)\n- Data category (e.g., 'd' = digital books)\n- Version/edition identifier\n\nStep 4: Derive statistical measures. With valid numerical data, potential metrics could include:\n1. Average review time (if time values)\n2. Percentage of books reviewed vs. received\n3. Distribution of book categories/subjects\n4. Correlation between review length (pages) and response time\n5. Frequency analysis of publisher contributions\n\nStep 5: Highlight limitations. The actual interpretation requires:\n- Clear column headers\n- Contextual metadata\n- Verification of data integrity (symbols like '∈x' and 'μμ W' appear corrupt/meaningless here)\n\nConclusion: While numerical values might represent review metrics or identifiers, the corrupted table format prevents definitive interpretation.

A completely labeled simplex has vertices that collectively cover all labels in $I^{n+1}$. By construction, this ensures that for each $i$, there exists a vertex where $z_{i}(x)$ is maximized, implying that the complementarity condition $x_{i}z_{i}(x) = 0$ is approximately satisfied. The accuracy of the solution improves as the mesh size of the subdivision decreases, making the approximation tighter.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the labeling function context\nIn this algorithm, the labeling function l(x) selects the smallest index i where z_i(x) achieves the maximum value among all components. This labeling mechanism creates a correspondence between simplex vertices and NLCP conditions.\n\nStep 2: Recognize complete labeling significance\nA completely labeled simplex contains all labels in I^{n+1}. This means each label corresponds to a vertex where its z_i(x) component is dominant, reflecting different aspects of the complementarity conditions simultaneously.\n\nStep 3: Connect labeling to NLCP requirements\nIn NLCP formulations, solutions require x_i · F_i(x) = 0 for all i. The maximum z_i(x) components tracked by labels implicitly capture these complementary relationships - particularly at boundary points where some x_i = 0.\n\nStep 4: Utilize simplex geometry properties\nThrough the algorithm's simplicial subdivision and movement rules (using matrix Q for vertex generation), completely labeled simplices become increasingly refined. The geometric properties of small completely labeled simplices ensure all z_i(x) values converge toward satisfying max conditions simultaneously.\n\nStep 5: Implement general labeling advantage\nThe algorithm's ability to handle boundary movements through general labellings directly addresses boundary conditions of NLCP (where complementarity variables become zero). This ensures proper tracking of both positive and zero-value variables during approximation.\n\nStep 6: Convergence through refinement\nAs the mesh size d decreases (seen in the y^i vertex formulas), the center point of a completely labeled simplex approximates a point where all z_i(x) conditions are approximately satisfied, yielding an NLCP solution through continuity of z functions.\n\nQID: Management-table-542-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-542-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains how the labeling function and completely labeled simplex ensure an approximate solution for the NLCP, matching the gold answer's key points about label coverage, complementarity conditions, and mesh refinement.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-542-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains how the labeling function and completely labeled simplex ensure an approximate solution for the NLCP, matching the gold answer's key points about label coverage, complementarity conditions, and mesh refinement."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-542-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains how the labeling function and completely labeled simplex ensure an approximate solution for the NLCP, matching the gold answer's key points about label coverage, complementarity conditions, and mesh refinement."}

The cost for item $i$ is: $$c_{i}(x_{i},a_{i}) = C_{i} + \\frac{h_{i}}{2\\lambda_{i}}(2a_{i}x_{i} + a_{i}^{2}),$$ where $C_{i}$ is the minor ordering cost for item $i$. Taking the derivative with respect to $a_{i}$ and setting it to zero: $$\\frac{dc_{i}}{da_{i}} = \\frac{h_{i}}{2\\lambda_{i}}(2x_{i} + 2a_{i}) = 0 \\implies x_{i} + a_{i} = 0.$$ However, this implies $a_{i} = -x_{i}$, which is not feasible since $a_{i} \\geq 0$. This suggests that the optimal policy is to replenish item $i$ only when its inventory level $x_{i}$ drops to zero, i.e., a zero-inventory ordering policy. The optimal replenishment quantity $a_{i}^{*}$ is then determined by the EOQ formula for item $i$: $$a_{i}^{*} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2C_{i}\\lambda_{i}}{h_{i}}}.$$ This minimizes the average cost per unit time for item $i$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the cost function\nGiven the cost function:\n$$c(x,a) = C_{\\mathrm{supp}(a)} + \\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{I}}\\frac{h_i}{2\\lambda_i}(2a_ix_i + a_i^2)$$\nThe first term represents joint fixed costs when items are replenished, and the second term captures holding costs related to inventory levels and replenishment quantities.\n\nStep 2: Focus on variable costs for differentiation\nWhen deriving optimal quantities $a_i^*$, the fixed cost $C_{\\mathrm{supp}(a)}$ becomes a step function (0 when $a_i=0$, fixed when $a_i>0$). For continuous optimization, we consider $a_i > 0$ where $C_{\\mathrm{supp}(a)}$ is constant, allowing us to focus on the differentiable portion of the cost function.\n\nStep 3: Take partial derivatives\nFor each item $i$, compute the partial derivative of the variable cost term with respect to $a_i$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a_i}\\left(\\frac{h_i}{2\\lambda_i}(2a_ix_i + a_i^2)\\right) = \\frac{h_i}{\\lambda_i}(x_i + a_i)$$\n\nStep 4: Set derivatives to zero\nTo minimize costs, set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{h_i}{\\lambda_i}(x_i + a_i) = 0 \\implies x_i + a_i = 0$$\nBut since $x_i$ (current inventory) and $a_i$ (replenishment quantity) are non-negative, this suggests $x_i = 0$ must hold at optimality (consistent with EOQ assumptions where replenishment occurs when inventory depletes).\n\nStep 5: Relate to EOQ framework\nIn steady-state operation:\n1. Demand rate $\\lambda_i$ drains inventory\n2. Cycle time $T_i = a_i/\\lambda_i$\n3. Average holding cost becomes $\\frac{h_i}{2\\lambda_i}a_i^2$\n4. Average fixed cost per unit time: $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{supp}(a)}\\lambda_i}{a_i}$\n\nStep 6: Optimize average cost\nMinimize the combined average cost:\n$$\\frac{C_i\\lambda_i}{a_i} + \\frac{h_i a_i}{2}$$\nTaking derivative w.r.t. $a_i$ and setting to zero yields:\n$$-\\frac{C_i\\lambda_i}{a_i^2} + \\frac{h_i}{2} = 0 \\implies a_i^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2C_i\\lambda_i}{h_i}}$$\n\nFinal Result:\nThe optimal replenishment quantity for each item follows the classic Economic Order Quantity formula:\n$$a_i^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{2C_i\\lambda_i}{h_i}}$$\n\nQID: Management-table-467-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-467-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly derives the optimal replenishment quantities using the EOQ formula, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion.

Explain the possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe higher $\\tau$ value for AAI indicates a stronger correlation with Olson's ratings, but the lower significance level suggests less statistical confidence. This discrepancy likely arises because the AAI scores were available for only 19 out of 31 journals, reducing the sample size ($N=19$). A smaller $N$ increases the variance in the correlation estimate, leading to a higher p-value. In contrast, PageRank's quality index uses all 31 journals ($N=31$), providing more stable estimates and thus a more significant p-value despite a slightly lower $\\tau$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Compare Key Metrics\n- AAI vs. Olson: Kendall’s τ = 0.6569 (stronger correlation), p-value = 0.00010 (N=19)\n- PageRank (β=1, γ=1) vs. Olson: τ = 0.5339 (weaker correlation), p-value = 0.00003 (N=31)\n\nStep 2: Analyze Sample Size Impact\nStatistical significance (p-value) depends on both effect size (τ) and sample size (N). While AAI has a larger τ, its smaller sample size (N=19 vs. N=31) increases the standard error of Kendall’s τ, reducing statistical power. The larger N=31 in PageRank compensates for its smaller τ, yielding a more significant p-value.\n\nStep 3: Verify via Standard Error Formula\nFor Kendall’s τ, SE ≈ √[(2(2n+5))/(9n(n−1))]. Calculations show:\n- AAI (N=19): SE ≈ 0.167 → z ≈ 3.93 → p≈0.0001\n- PageRank (N=31): SE ≈ 0.127 → z ≈ 4.22 → p≈0.00003\n\nConclusion: The discrepancy arises because PageRank’s larger sample size (31 vs. 19) disproportionately improves significance despite its weaker correlation with Olson (2005).\n\nQID: Management-table-254-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-254-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly explains the discrepancy by comparing metrics, analyzing sample size impact, and verifying with standard error calculations, aligning perfectly with the gold answer's reasoning.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-254-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the discrepancy by comparing metrics, analyzing sample size impact, and verifying with standard error calculations, aligning perfectly with the gold answer's reasoning."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-254-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer thoroughly explains the discrepancy by comparing metrics, analyzing sample size impact, and verifying with standard error calculations, aligning perfectly with the gold answer's reasoning."}

Since the formula context lists η as a parameter and the table lists 'n' values (which likely correspond to η based on starting values and notation alignment), η = n.\n\nTraditional Model:\nμ = 0.0165, η = 0.0738\nReverse Model:\nμ = 0.0236, η = 0.0716\n\nStep 2: Compute μ/η ratios:\n- Traditional: 0.0165 / 0.0738 ≈ 0.2236\n- Reverse: 0.0236 / 0.0716 ≈ 0.3296\n\nStep 3: Analyze cross-elasticity implications. A higher μ/η ratio (Reverse ≈ 0.33 vs. Traditional ≈ 0.22) indicates stronger cross-elasticity effects in the Reverse Model.

Provide a step-by-step reasoning.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine the minimum number of turn nodes and ground arcs, we analyze the available and departure times step-by-step:\n\n1. **Flight $f_{1}$**: Available at 3:00 PM. Possible departures after 3:30 PM (3:45 PM, 4:00 PM, 4:05 PM).\n2. **Flight $f_{2}$**: Available at 3:30 PM. Possible departures after 4:00 PM (4:00 PM, 4:05 PM).\n3. **Flight $f_{3}$**: Available at 4:00 PM. Possible departures after 4:30 PM (none in the table, but the next departure is 4:05 PM, which is before 4:30 PM). Thus, $f_{3}$ cannot turn to any departure.\n\nSince $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ can turn to multiple departures, but $f_{3}$ cannot, we need:\n- **Turn Nodes**: 2 (one for $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ and another for $f_{3}$).\n- **Ground Arcs**: 1 (to represent the idle time between $f_{2}$ and $f_{3}$).\n\nThus, the minimum configuration is 2 turn nodes and 1 ground arc.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract unique event times from the table. Available times (incoming flights) are 3:00PM, 3:30PM (f₁), and 4:00PM (f₃). Departure times (outgoing flights) are 3:45PM (f₄), 4:00PM (f₅), and 4:05PM (f₆). Combined unique times: 3:00PM, 3:30PM, 3:45PM, 4:00PM, 4:05PM.\n\nStep 2: Nodes represent these unique times. At 4:00PM, both an available time (f₃) and departure (f₅) occur, sharing a node. Total nodes = 5.\n\nStep 3: Ground arcs connect consecutive nodes sequentially: 3:00PM→3:30PM, 3:30PM→3:45PM, 3:45PM→4:00PM, 4:00PM→4:05PM. Total ground arcs = 4.\n\nStep 4: Turn arcs connect available nodes to valid departure nodes (departure ≥ available). For 3:00PM: 3 turns (3:45PM, 4:00PM, 4:05PM). For 3:30PM: 3 turns. For 4:00PM: 2 turns. Total turns = 8, but the question only asks for node/arc counts, not turn arcs.\n\nFinal Answer: Minimum 5 turn nodes and 4 ground arcs.\n\nQID: Management-table-405-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-405-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's approach of counting all unique event times as nodes is incorrect for determining the minimum turn nodes and ground arcs.

Theorem 1 is in effect, meaning the premium constraint is not binding for maturities up to the 14th year.\n2. For earlier maturities, the coupon rates are set at their upper bounds to maximize the bid premium, resulting in prices above 100.00 (e.g., 108.33 for the 3-year bond).\n3. At the 14-year maturity, the coupon rate equals the yield, implying the bond is priced at par (100.00). This is calculated as:\n   $$\n   P = \\sum_{t=1}^{14} \\frac{4.85}{(1+0.0485)^t} + \\frac{100}{(1+0.0485)^{14}} = 4.85 \\times \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.0485)^{-14}}{0.0485}\\right) + \\frac{100}{(1.0485)^{14}}\n   $$\n   $$\n   = 4.85 \\times 9.635 + 100 / 1.948 = 46.73 + 51.33 = 98.06\n   $$\n   The tabulated price of 100.00 suggests rounding or a simplified calculation, but the principle holds: when coupon rate equals yield, the bond price equals par value.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the context from Theorem 1 and Problem 2 description. In Problem 2, the maximum bid premium constraint isn't binding, allowing coupons to be set at their upper bounds for early maturities. Step 2: Observe that bonds with coupons higher than their reoffering yields (e.g., 7.00% vs 3.10% in Year 1) trade at premiums (prices >100) because their coupon payments exceed market yields. Step 3: Note the 14-year maturity has coupon = yield (4.85% = 4.85%), which mathematically results in a par price of 100.00. Step 4: Recognize that the algorithm minimizes TIC rate by maximizing coupons up to price constraints (≤108.50) for early maturities. However, starting at Year 14, the non-decreasing reoffering yield curve reaches a point where further coupon increases would either (a) no longer reduce TIC effectively or (b) potentially violate price constraints if extended. Thus, coupons align with yields from Year 14 onward to maintain par pricing while satisfying TIC optimization objectives.\n\nQID: Management-table-785-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-785-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately explains why the 14-year maturity has a coupon rate equal to the reoffering yield and a bond price of 100.00, while earlier maturities have higher coupon rates and prices above 100.00.

How does this structural property influence the computational complexity when solving for nondominated solutions with $K=5$ objective functions?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the ratio of transshipment nodes to total nodes for category C.\\nTotal transshipment nodes = $n_s^{\\prime} + n_d^{\\prime} = 90 + 90 = 180$.\\nTotal nodes $n = 300$.\\nRatio = $\\frac{180}{300} = 0.6$.\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate the ratio of arcs to nodes for category C.\\nArcs $a = 6,000$, nodes $n = 300$.\\nRatio = $\\frac{6,000}{300} = 20$.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze computational complexity.\\nThe high transshipment ratio (0.6) indicates a dense network structure with many intermediate nodes, increasing the number of possible paths. The arc-to-node ratio of 20 suggests a highly connected network. For $K=5$ objectives, the computational complexity grows as $O((n + a)^K)$ due to the multi-objective nature. Thus, the dense structure (evidenced by both ratios) leads to higher computational effort when generating nondominated solutions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract Problem Category C parameters from Table 1:\n- Total nodes (n) = 300\n- Arcs (a) = 6,000\n- Transshipment supply nodes (n'_s) = 90\n- Transshipment demand nodes (n'_d) = 90\n\nStep 2: Calculate transshipment nodes ratio:\nTotal transshipment nodes = 90 + 90 = 180\nRatio = 180/300 = 0.6 (60%)\n\nStep 3: Calculate arcs-to-nodes ratio:\nRatio = 6,000/300 = 20 (20:1)\n\nStep 4: Compare ratios:\nTransshipment ratio = 60% vs Arcs/nodes ratio = 20:1\n\nThe structural impact:\n1.

With K=5 objectives, this combination exponentially increases:\n   - Solution space dimensionality\n   - Number of potential Pareto-optimal solutions\n   - Required constraint evaluations per iteration\n4. Dense networks require more computational resources for:\n   - Flow variable management\n   - Multi-objective trade-off analysis\n   - Nondominated solution filtering\nResulting in significantly higher computational complexity compared to sparser networks with fewer transshipment nodes.\n\nQID: Management-table-438-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-438-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates both ratios, compares them, and accurately explains how the dense network structure increases computational complexity for K=5 objectives.

For $t \\in \\left(\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{1}{k+1}\\right)$, the solution set is $\\{(\\alpha, -\\alpha, -1) | \\alpha \\in [-h(t), h(t)]\\}$. Show that the optimal solution set is continuous at $t = \\frac{1}{k}$ and analyze the behavior as $t \\to 0^+$ to determine if $t = 0$ is an irregular accumulation point.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nFor $t = \\frac{1}{k}$, the feasible region is the intersection between the Cayley spectrahedron and the plane $x - y = 0$, leading to the solution $(0, 0, -1)$. For $t \\in \\left(\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{1}{k+1}\\right)$, the solution set is $\\{(\\alpha, -\\alpha, -1) | \\alpha \\in [-h(t), h(t)]\\}$. As $t \\to \\frac{1}{k}^+$, $h(t) \\to 0$ because $\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{t}) \\to 0$. Thus, the solution set collapses to $(0, 0, -1)$, ensuring continuity at $t = \\frac{1}{k}$. As $t \\to 0^+$, $h(t) = t\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{t}) \\to 0$ because $t \\to 0$ and $\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{t})$ is bounded. The solution set again collapses to $(0, 0, -1)$. However, the sequence $t_k = \\frac{1}{k}$ consists of continuous bifurcation points, and the limit $t \\to 0^+$ involves an infinite number of such points. This accumulation of continuous bifurcation points at $t = 0$ confirms it as an irregular accumulation point.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze continuity at t = 1/k. For t = 1/k, h(t) = t sin²(π/t) = (1/k) sin²(kπ) = 0, so the solution set reduces to {(0, 0, -1)}. For adjacent intervals (1/(k+1), 1/k), solutions alternate between (t, -t, -1) and (-t, t, -1). As t → 1/k from either side, these solutions approach (±1/k, ∓1/k, -1), which are contained in the t = 1/k solution set {α ∈ [-1/k, 1/k]}. Thus, the solution set is continuous at t = 1/k via upper semicontinuity.\n\nStep 2: Examine behavior as t → 0⁺. As t approaches 0, solutions in alternating intervals approach (0, 0, -1) due to t → 0. However, f(t) = t sin(π/t) and g(t) = 2t generate infinitely many oscillatory solution switches between (t, -t, -1) and (-t, t, -1) near t = 0. While the limit point (0, 0, -1) matches t = 0’s solution, the accumulation of infinitely many solution branches (via k → ∞) violates nonsingularity assumptions.

Assume $C(t) = C_0 e^{-rt}$, where $C_0$ is the initial cost and $r$ is the decay rate. Step 2: Using 1990 ($t=0$) and 2000 ($t=10$) data: $C(0) = 22$, $C(10) = 7$. Solve $7 = 22 e^{-10r}$ for $r$. Step 3: $r = -\\frac{1}{10} \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{22}\\right) \\approx 0.114$ (11.4% annual decay). Step 4: This decay suggests decreasing HIV-related costs over time, which may allow reallocation of resources to other health-care needs, but must be balanced against potential underreporting or data lag effects.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the 'TOTAL, HIV +' cost data from 1990 (year 0) to 2000 (year 10): $22, $21, $20, $19, $17, $15, $13, $11, $10, $8, $7.\n\nStep 2: Assume an exponential decay model \\( C(t) = C_0 e^{-rt} \\).

Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the method has a statistically significant effect on 'Leader evaluations'.\n\nStep 2: For 'Likelihood of using', the p-value is 0.10, which is greater than the significance level of 0.05.

The concavity allows the separation problem to be solved as a linear program (SepLR) with polynomial-time complexity, as the optimal solution can be found at integer values of $r_i$ and the constraints can be efficiently generated.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Monotonicity conditions in Lemma 1 ensure the value functions $v_{i,t}(r_i)$ in the piecewise-linear (PL) approximation maintain a non-increasing property with respect to remaining capacity $r_i$. This reflects the intuitive requirement that less available capacity cannot yield higher expected value.\n\nStep 2: These conditions enforce structural regularity on the approximation, guaranteeing that each linear segment's slope decreases (or remains constant) as $r_i$ increases. This property induces concavity-like behavior in the value functions.\n\nStep 3: For the separation problem - which identifies violated constraints during LP solving - the monotonic structure allows violations to be detected by checking only a polynomial number of critical points (e.g., breakpoints between linear segments) rather than exponentially many possibilities.\n\nStep 4: Specifically, the ordered slope changes from monotonicity enable efficient constraint verification through sequential comparisons. This reduces the separation problem to operations with time complexity linear in the number of segments, ensuring polynomial-time solvability.\n\nStep 5: Combined with Proposition 2's equivalence between (PL) and (LR), these conditions preserve solution quality while making the PL approach computationally tractable despite its tighter approximation compared to Lagrangian relaxation.\n\nQID: Management-table-565-3\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-565-3\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately explains the significance of the monotonicity conditions in Lemma 1 and how they ensure polynomial-time solvability of the separation problem.

The identity $\\text{PopExp}_{TS} = \\text{PopExp}_{ND}$ and $\\text{Dist}_{TS} = \\text{Dist}_{ND}$ implies that carriers avoid risky arcs without tolls, achieving the same risk mitigation as ND. Mathematically, $\\text{Tpaid} = 0$ confirms tolls are not levied, as arcs are closed instead.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the Rmin=10,000 row in the table. Both ND and TS show identical PopExp=699.46 and Dist=33.73 values. This convergence occurs because at extremely high Rmin constraints (representing stringent toll-free road requirements), the remaining feasible network configurations become identical for both approaches, eliminating any optimization difference between network design and toll-setting strategies.\n\nStep 2: Observe Tpaid=0 in the TS column. This indicates zero toll revenue was collected, implying the toll policy becomes non-existent under these constraints. The Rmin=10,000 constraint forces all arcs to remain toll-free (100% of required toll-free arcs), making toll-setting impossible despite being a toll-setting experiment.

The conditional probability $P(\\text{PH} | \\text{not GH})$ is the number admitted to PH divided by the total catchment-area insured patients not admitted to GH. However, since GH admits insured catchment patients if space is available, the 'not admitted to GH' scenario implies GH is at capacity.

Since there are no other options, this reduces to 244/244 = 1 (or 100%).\nStep 4: Interpretation: This 100% probability indicates PH acts as a full safety net for catchment-insured patients not admitted to GH, reflecting prioritization where GH selects certain insured catchment patients (likely based on specific criteria), while PH systematically accepts all remaining cases to ensure complete coverage.\n\nQID: Management-table-146-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-146-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's calculation of 100% probability is incorrect because it fails to account for the total population of catchment-area insured patients not admitted to GH (which includes both PH and GH admissions).

Calculate the adjusted R² given that there are 3 predictors and 51 observations. How does this reflect the explanatory power of the model?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe adjusted R² is calculated as $1 - (1 - R^2)\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$, where $n=51$ and $p=3$. Substituting the values: $1 - (1 - 0.24)\\frac{50}{47} = 1 - 0.76 \\times 1.0638 = 1 - 0.8085 = 0.1915$. The adjusted R² of 0.1915 indicates that approximately 19.15% of the variance in frequency is explained by the model after adjusting for the number of predictors, suggesting moderate explanatory power.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify formula for adjusted R²\nAdjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²)(n - 1)/(n - k - 1)]\nWhere:\n- R² = 0.24 (given)\n- n = 51 observations\n- k = 3 predictors\n\nStep 2: Plug values into formula\n= 1 - [(1 - 0.24)(51 - 1)/(51 - 3 - 1)]\n= 1 - [(0.76)(50)/47]\n\nStep 3: Calculate numerator and denominator\n= 1 - [38/47]\n= 1 - 0.8085\n\nStep 4: Final calculation\n= 0.1915 (or 19.15%)\n\nInterpretation: The adjusted R² of ~0.19 indicates that after accounting for sample size and number of predictors, the model explains about 19% of variance in frequency.

According to the cross lag correlation technique, if the dominant causal direction is from LJA to LMS, then $r\\{LJA_{t-1}LMS_{t}\\} > r\\{LJA_{t}LMS_{t-1}\\}$. Here, 0.48 > 0.17, which supports the hypothesis that journal advertising (LJA) causally affects market share (LMS) rather than vice versa.

What does this value indicate about the relationship between PC encouragement and firm performance?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe structure correlation coefficient for 'Encourage PC (PCUSE)' in the 4-variable model is 0.635. This value indicates the correlation between the discriminant function (which separates ABOVE and BELOW average performance) and the variable PCUSE. A high positive correlation (0.635) suggests that firms that encourage PC usage are more likely to be classified in the ABOVE average performance category. This implies that PC encouragement has a strong positive association with firm performance.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Locate the 'Encourage PC (PCUSE)' row in Table 5.

Step 2: Rearrange to solve for $(T S)^{2}$: $(T S)^{2} = FCFS-G \\times (1 - 0.17) = 1,923 \\times 0.83 \\approx 1,596.09$. Step 3: The table reports $(T S)^{2} = 1,594$ for Instance 18. The calculated value (1,596.09) is very close, with the minor difference likely due to rounding the improvement percentage to 17%.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Use the improvement formula. The improvement percentage (17%) is calculated as (FCFS-G − (TS)²)/FCFS-G.\nStep 2: Let (TS)² = x.

This is calculated as $(upper\\ bound - lower\\ bound)/upper\\ bound$. \nStep 2: The improvement percentage of $T^2S$ is calculated as $\\frac{2,284 - 1,239}{2,284} \\times 100 \\approx 45.75\\%$. \nStep 3: The comparison reveals that while CPLEX has a high gap (indicating poor performance), $T^2S$ achieves a substantial improvement (45.75%), demonstrating its efficiency in finding better solutions quickly.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the gap for CPLEX using the formula:\nGap (%) = [(CPLEX Objective - T²S Objective) / T²S Objective] × 100\n= [(2,284 - 1,239) / 1,239] × 100 ≈ (1,045 / 1,239) × 100 ≈ 84.3%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the improvement percentage of T²S compared to CPLEX using:\nImprovement (%) = [(CPLEX Objective - T²S Objective) / CPLEX Objective] × 100\n= [(2,284 - 1,239) / 2,284] × 100 ≈ (1,045 / 2,284) × 100 ≈ 45.7%\n\nStep 3: Compare the values. The gap (84.3%) shows CPLEX’s solution is 84.3% worse than T²S’s solution, while T²S achieved a 45.7% improvement over CPLEX. This large discrepancy highlights that T²S is significantly more efficient than the truncated CPLEX algorithm, as it produces a far superior solution in seconds compared to CPLEX’s two-hour effort.\n\nQID: Management-table-512-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-512-2\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly calculated the improvement percentage of T²S (45.7%) but incorrectly calculated the CPLEX gap (84.3% instead of 93.2%).

Provide a step-by-step explanation using the Chablis frame as an example.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total price for Chablis, the following steps are taken:\n1. The Chablis frame inherits the Calc_Price procedure from the Beverage frame via the 'is_a' and 'ako' slots.\n2. The Chablis frame provides the specific values for quantity (20) and unit_price (7.40).\n3. The Calc_Price procedure is executed with these values: $total\\_price = quantity \\times unit\\_price = 20 \\times 7.40 = 148.00$.\n4. The result, 148.00, is stored in the total_price slot of the Chablis frame.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The Chablis frame inherits from the Beverage frame through an IS-A or AKO relationship, gaining access to its slots and procedures.\nStep 2: When calculating total_price for Chablis, the system first checks if the instance frame has its own Calc_Price procedure.\nStep 3: If no local procedure exists (as in this case), the inheritance mechanism retrieves the Calc_Price procedure from the Beverage frame's Slot 5 (if_needed facet).\nStep 4: The inherited Calc_Price procedure executes using slot values from the Chablis frame's own Slot 3 (quantity and unit_price values stored locally).\nStep 5: Mathematical calculation is performed using the formula: total_price = quantity × unit_price, where quantity and unit_price are specific to the Chablis instance.\nStep 6: The result is returned as the total_price for the Chablis instance while maintaining inheritance from the Beverage class frame.\n\nQID: Management-table-63-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-63-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer accurately follows the steps outlined in the gold answer, detailing the inheritance mechanism, procedure execution, and calculation process.

With $S=1$ and $R=2$, this becomes $648 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 1296$ runs. Step 2: The reduced design splits the experiment into cost experiments and horizon experiments. For cost experiments with imperfect forecasts, the number of runs is $(36)(S) = 36$. For perfect forecasts, it is $(18)(S) = 18$. For horizon experiments with imperfect forecasts, it is $(12)(S) = 12$, and for perfect forecasts, it is $(24)(S) = 24$. Step 3: The total reduced runs sum to $36 + 18 + 12 + 24 = 90$, which is significantly less than the 1296 runs required for the complete design.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the formula for the Complete Design's total runs from Table 1.\nThe 'Total Number of Runs' for the Complete Design is given as (648)(R)(S).\n\nStep 2: Substitute values R=2 and S=1 into the formula.\nTotal Runs = 648 × R × S = 648 × 2 × 1 = 1,296 runs.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Reduced Design's computational reduction.\nThe Reduced Design splits experiments into Cost Experiments (Imperfect: 36S, Perfect: 18S) and Horizon Experiments (Imperfect: 12S, Perfect: 24S).

Given that the average absolute deviation across all concepts is 0.07, the deviation for Concept H is significantly higher. The context states that the range of existing brand data was greatly exceeded for Concept H, which likely explains the larger deviation. The difference is noted as significantly different at the 10 percent level, indicating that the model's prediction for Concept H may not be reliable due to the out-of-range data.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate absolute deviation\nAbsolute Deviation = |Predicted Trial - Observed Trial| = |1.00 - 0.72| = 0.28\n\nStep 2: Analyze statistical significance context\n- The formula context describes trial calculation methodology but doesn't provide significance thresholds\n- The heading 'Model Testing' implies predictive accuracy evaluation\n- Key phrase: 'range of existing brand data was greatly exceeded for Concept H'\n\nStep 3: Interpret implications\nWhen predictions exceed the model's original data range:\n1.

First, engage stakeholders to define the initial state (PIS) using tools like rich pictures or cognitive maps. Then, use multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to articulate potential goal states (PGS). The process involves iterative modeling and stakeholder feedback to refine the problem structure. The outcome is a framework for understanding the problem, rather than a precise solution, due to the inherent ambiguity.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recognize that welfare reform falls under the PIS-PGS category (poorly-defined initial state and poorly-defined goal state), requiring methods to address ambiguity in both problem framing and outcome definition.\n\nStep 2: Begin with problem structuring to clarify initial conditions. Use stakeholder analysis, historical data reviews, and qualitative interviews to map fragmented perspectives on current welfare system challenges (PIS ambiguity resolution).\n\nStep 3: Employ inductive methods like soft systems methodology or participatory workshops to collaboratively define potential goal states (PGS exploration), balancing conflicting political, economic, and social objectives.\n\nStep 4: Use scenario planning or system dynamics modeling to explore how different interventions might interact with ambiguous initial conditions and evolving societal values, as suggested by the 'inducing structure' solution method in Table 1.\n\nStep 5: Implement an iterative design incorporating adaptive management principles, allowing continuous redefinition of both problem understanding (PIS) and success metrics (PGS) as new information emerges.\n\nStep 6: Integrate multi-criteria decision analysis to handle competing objectives, complemented by sensitivity analysis to test solution robustness against remaining uncertainties in initial conditions and outcome preferences.\n\nStep 7: Include mechanisms for ongoing stakeholder engagement and ethical reflection throughout the study lifecycle, acknowledging the value-laden nature of both problem definition and outcome evaluation in welfare reform.\n\nQID: Management-table-350-3\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-350-3\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly addresses the ambiguity in both initial conditions and desired outcomes of welfare reform, aligning with the gold answer's emphasis on problem structuring methods and iterative stakeholder engagement.

Our model introduces dynamic arrivals and multiple items, which increases the state space exponentially. For $N$ items and $T$ periods, the complexity becomes $O(N \\cdot T^4)$, as each item's arrival and due date must be tracked dynamically, and multiple setups per period must be considered. The added dimensions of dynamic arrivals ($d_i$) and item heterogeneity ($h_i^o, h_i^d$) require more extensive dynamic programming recursions.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key differences in model parameters from Table 1. Florian & Klein (1971) has: (1) single-item processing ('one' under No. of Items), and (2) no dynamic arrivals. Our model has: (1) 'one or more' items, and (2) 'yes' for dynamic arrivals.\n\nStep 2: Analyze dynamic arrivals impact. Dynamic arrivals require real-time scheduling adjustments as orders become available during the finite horizon rather than being fully known upfront. This transforms the problem into a dynamic programming challenge with recurring optimization cycles, increasing time/space complexity due to continuous state updates and decision-making requirements.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate multiple items impact. Supporting multiple items introduces combinatorial complexity from item-specific setups/tracking and resource allocation conflicts. The solution space grows exponentially with each additional item (O(n^k) vs O(n) for single-item models) due to interdependencies between item scheduling and vehicle assignments.\n\nStep 4: Combine effects. While Florian & Klein's model has polynomial-time complexity for static single-item scheduling, our model's dual enhancements create NP-hard complexity due to concurrent management of time-dependent arrivals and multi-dimensional resource allocation - mirroring characteristics of combined vehicle routing and dynamic scheduling problems.\n\nQID: Management-table-583-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-583-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer thoroughly analyzes the impact of dynamic arrivals and multiple items on computational complexity, aligning with the gold answer's explanation of increased state space and exponential complexity.

Let $C$ be the cost of cancellations, $T$ be the additional travel time cost, and $x$ be the decision variables representing rerouting choices. The objectives are $\\min C(x)$ and $\\min T(x)$. To handle the trade-offs, we can use a weighted sum approach: $\\min \\alpha C(x) + (1-\\alpha) T(x)$, where $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ represents the decision-maker's preference. The solution involves solving this weighted problem for different values of $\\alpha$ to explore the Pareto frontier.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify WIS-PGS characteristics. The problem has a Well-defined Initial State (current aircraft positions, weather delays, and flight schedules) but a Poorly-defined Goal State (competing objectives of minimizing cancellation costs vs. additional travel time costs).\n\nStep 2: Establish decision variables. Define rerouting options (alternative flight paths), cancellation status (binary variables), and time delays (continuous variables) for each affected aircraft.\n\nStep 3: Quantify costs. Calculate cancellation costs (refunds, reputation damage, rebooking logistics) and additional travel time costs (fuel burn, crew overtime, passenger compensation) using airline-specific operational data.\n\nStep 4: Apply multi-objective optimization. Use ε-constraint method or weighted sum approach to handle conflicting objectives:\n   Minimize Total Cost = α*(Cancellation Costs) + β*(Travel Time Costs)\n   Where α and β are weights reflecting operational priorities\n\nStep 5: Incorporate constraints. Include airspace capacity, crew duty limits, airport curfews, and connection preservation requirements as linear/non-linear constraints.\n\nStep 6: Implement transformation method. Use mixed-integer programming to model discrete cancellation decisions and continuous rerouting parameters, aligning with the WIS-PGS solution method from Mayer's framework.\n\nStep 7: Generate Pareto frontier. Present multiple viable solutions showing cancellation/time cost trade-offs for human decision-makers, acknowledging the PGS nature where no single 'optimal' solution exists.\n\nStep 8: Integrate real-time updates.

It is defined as $\\underline{{\\partial}}\\mathbb{H}=\\{(b,C(b))\\colon b\\in\\mathbb{B}\\},$ where $C(b)\\triangleq\\operatorname*{inf}\\{f^{\\pi}\\colon g^{\\pi}=b,\\pi\\in\\Pi\\}$. This frontier is piecewise linear and convex, reflecting the trade-off between work and cost. The MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ emerges as the slope of this frontier, indicating the marginal rate of cost reduction per unit increase in work, thus guiding optimal resource allocation.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The work-cost efficient frontier ∂ℍ represents the Pareto-optimal trade-off between work (resource allocation effort) and cost in restless bandit problems. It characterizes achievable combinations where one cannot reduce cost without increasing work expenditure, or vice versa.\n\nStep 2: In multi-class queueing systems modeled as restless bandits, this frontier emerges from diminishing returns properties and partial conservation laws (PCLs) shown in the table's last row. These structural properties allow decomposition of complex scheduling problems.\n\nStep 3: Marginal Productivity Indices (MPIs) ν_i* = -Δf^{S_i}/Δg^{S_i} from the formula context rank classes by their work-to-cost efficiency ratios. The frontier ∂ℍ defines the operational boundary where these MPIs determine optimal activation thresholds.\n\nStep 4: Its significance lies in enabling index-based policies: when system parameters lie on ∂ℍ, MPI priorities become optimal. This extends Klimov's and Whittle's indexability results to countable-state systems with convex costs, as indicated in the paper's scope from the table's final row.\n\nStep 5: The frontier formalizes how increased workload (throughput) requires accepting higher costs (congestion/backlog), while cost reduction necessitates work prioritization - a fundamental trade-off in make-to-order/make-to-stock queue control.\n\nQID: Management-table-683-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-683-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately describes the significance of the work-cost efficient frontier in restless bandit problems, including its role in Pareto-optimal trade-offs, the emergence of MPIs, and its application in index-based policies.

The objective is to minimize the total material handling cost, which can be expressed as $\\min \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n f_{ij} \\cdot d_{ij}$. Constraints include ensuring each facility is assigned to a unique location and the distances are non-negative. The simplex algorithm can then be applied to find the optimal layout.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Define decision variables. Let binary variable x_ik = 1 if facility i is assigned to location k, 0 otherwise.\n\nStep 2: Formulate the objective function. Minimize total cost = Σ (flow rate between facilities i and j) × (distance between locations k and l) × x_ik × x_jl for all i,j,k,l.

How does this compare to the theoretical variance when $\\lambda = 0$?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma$ is the square root of the variance: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{m^{(2)}} = \\sqrt{91.31} \\approx 9.56$ ft/sec. For $\\lambda = 0$, the theoretical variance is 623.90 (ft/sec)$^2$, giving $\\sigma_{\\text{theory}} = \\sqrt{623.90} \\approx 24.98$ ft/sec. The observed standard deviation is significantly lower, indicating the adjustment term's importance in reducing variance.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the standard deviation from the given variance. The variance m² is 91.31 (ft/sec)², so standard deviation = √(91.31) ≈ 9.56 ft/sec.\n\nStep 2: Analyze theoretical variance at λ = 0. The formula context states the adjustment term λ reduces variance. When λ = 0, there is no adjustment, meaning the theoretical variance would equal the unadjusted variance.\n\nStep 3: Compare values. Since the provided variance (91.31) already includes the λ-based adjustment, the theoretical variance at λ = 0 would be greater than 91.31 (ft/sec)².

The gamma distribution with $p=0.5$ has higher variance ($\\text{Var}=1/p=2$) compared to $p=2.0$ ($\\text{Var}=0.5$). Higher variability leads to more short abandonment times, causing more customers to abandon and making the heavy-traffic approximation less accurate. This explains the larger error (6.57% vs 2.27%) for $p=0.5$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Examine Table 1 error percentages. For p=0.5, the queue length error is 6.57% vs. 2.27% for p=2.0, and abandonment probability error is 4.63% vs. 2.80%. The approximation performs worse at p=0.5.\n\nStep 2: Recall the hazard rate scaling framework in the formula context. The cumulative hazard function H(x) involves Γ(p, px) (incomplete Gamma function), implying the hazard rate variability depends critically on parameter p.\n\nStep 3: Lower p-values (like 0.5) correspond to higher hazard rate variability in the abandonment time distribution. This higher variability increases sensitivity to approximations in the nonlinear drift term -H(s) of the diffusion process.\n\nStep 4: Higher p-values (like 2.0) produce more stable/regular hazard rate behavior (due to Gamma distribution properties), reducing modeling mismatch in the exponential steady-state formula p(x)=Mexp⁡(...). The approximation better captures system dynamics when hazard rates are less variable.\n\nStep 5: Heavy traffic diffusion approximations rely on 'smoother' stochastic behavior.

The BOUND value (217,477) is compared to other feasible solutions (e.g., node 19 with BOUND 219,280*) and is likely the best found so far.\n4. **Mathematical Confirmation**: The cost at node 20 is lower than other feasible nodes (e.g., 217,477 < 219,280), confirming its optimality status.

Calculate the percentage reduction in congestion addition to private trip time (7.6 min to 1.2 min) and relate it to the change in modal split (23.5% to 55.9%) using the concept of decongestion effects.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate percentage reduction in congestion time.\n$$\\frac{7.6 - 1.2}{7.6} \\times 100 = 84.21\\%$$\n\nStep 2: Relate to modal split change.\nThe modal split change from 23.5% to 55.9% implies a 32.4% point increase in public transportation usage. This diverts a significant number of travelers from private to public modes, reducing road congestion.\n\nStep 3: Analyze decongestion effect.\nThe 84.21% reduction in congestion time is disproportionately larger than the 32.4% point increase in public mode share. This nonlinear relationship can be explained by traffic flow theory, where vehicle speed is inversely related to traffic density. Reducing the number of private vehicles leads to a more than proportional increase in speed due to decreased interactions between vehicles.\n\nMathematically, this can be approximated by the Greenshields model:\n$$v = v_f \\left(1 - \\frac{k}{k_j}\\right)$$\nwhere $v$ is speed, $v_f$ is free-flow speed, $k$ is density, and $k_j$ is jam density. A reduction in $k$ (due to modal shift) leads to a greater-than-linear increase in $v$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate percentage reduction in congestion-added trip time\nOld value = 7.6 min\nNew value = 1.2 min\nReduction = (7.6 - 1.2)/7.6 × 100 = 6.4/7.6 × 100 ≈ 84.21%\n\nStep 2: Analyze modal split change\nPublic transportation usage increased from 23.5% to 55.9% (Δ32.4 percentage points)\n\nStep 3: Relate through decongestion effects\nThe 84.21% reduction in congestion delay corresponds with:\n1. Increased airline speed for private vehicles (18.5 → 30.2 mph)\n2. Dramatic modal shift to public transit\nThis demonstrates the decongestion principle: As more travelers switch to public transit (modal split change), road congestion decreases significantly, which:\n- Reduces trip time penalties for remaining private vehicles\n- Creates a positive feedback loop encouraging mode shift\n- Is evidenced by the inverse relationship between public transit adoption rates and congestion metrics in the table data.\n\nQID: Management-table-508-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-508-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates the percentage reduction in congestion time and accurately relates it to the change in modal split, including a discussion of decongestion effects.

The probability density function (PDF) is $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$. This can lead to errors if the actual demand does not follow this distribution.\n\n2. **Simulation-Optimization Approach**: Uses empirical data to estimate the demand distribution. The empirical CDF $F_n(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i \\leq x)$, where $I$ is the indicator function, provides a more accurate representation of demand.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The error in the traditional approach can be quantified as $\\int |f(x) - f_{true}(x)| dx$, where $f_{true}(x)$ is the true demand PDF. The simulation-optimization approach minimizes this error by using $F_n(x)$, which converges to $F_{true}(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$ (Glivenko-Cantelli theorem).\n\nThus, the simulation-optimization approach reduces modeling errors by leveraging empirical data instead of assuming a specific distribution.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the core distinction\nTraditional approaches rely on parametric distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson) requiring strict assumptions about demand distribution parameters (μ, σ). The simulation-optimization approach uses empirical distributions from historical data points {d₁,d₂,...,dₙ} without parametric assumptions.\n\nStep 2: Define demand representation\nLet D_tr ∼ F(θ) where F is a specific distribution with parameters θ in traditional methods,\nvs\nD_so ∼ \\(\\hat{F}_n(d) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n I(d_i \\leq d)\\) (empirical CDF) in simulation-optimization.\n\nStep 3: Formulate cost optimization\nTraditional: Minimize E_{D∼F(θ)}[C(Q,D)]\nSimulation: Minimize \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n C(Q,d_i)\\) across empirical realizations\n\nStep 4: Mathematical advantage\nEmpirical distributions eliminate distributional error ε = |F(θ) - F_true| that plagues traditional methods.

If it's a reporting factor, the actual new HIV cases $A_t$ might be estimated as $A_t = \\frac{\\text{HIV,NEW}_t}{M_t}$.\n\nStep 2: For 1990: $A_{1990} = \\frac{176160}{0.12} = 1,468,000$ cases. Similarly for 2000: $A_{2000} = \\frac{20715}{0.01} = 2,071,500$ cases.\n\nStep 3: The decreasing trend in $M_t$ (0.12 → 0.01) suggests either:\n- Improved reporting efficiency (smaller correction needed)\n- Reduced transmission rates (smaller proportion of population transitioning)\n- Changes in surveillance methodology\n\nThis requires domain knowledge to interpret correctly, but the mathematical relationship shows how raw data is scaled to estimates.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the relationship\nFrom the data, annual new HIV cases (HIV,NEW) decrease alongside the MULTIPLIER values across years (0.12 → 0.01). Mathematical verification shows HIV,NEW ≈ MULTIPLIER × HIV,NEW-CUM (cumulative new cases) for each year. For example:\n- 1990: 0.12 × 1,488,496 ≈ 176,160\n- 2000: 0.01 × 2,258,165 ≈ 22,581 (close to reported 20,715, considering rounding).\nThis confirms the relationship: **HIV,NEW = MULTIPLIER × HIV,NEW-CUM**.\n\nStep 2: Interpret biological implications\nThe decreasing multiplier indicates annual new infections constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of cumulative cases. Biologically, this suggests:\n1. Effective prevention programs (e.g., education, condom use, PrEP) reducing transmission rates.\n2. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) lowering viral load and infectivity.\n3. Natural saturation in high-risk populations.\n\nStep 3: Analyze reporting implications\nIf the MULTIPLIER represents underreporting correction:\n1. A declining trend implies improved case detection/reporting systems (less underreporting over time).\n2. Reduced need for upward adjustment of reported figures, reflecting higher data accuracy in later years.\n\nStep 4: Combined significance\nThe simultaneous decline in both MULTIPLIER and HIV,NEW strongly indicates successful epidemic control through biomedical interventions and surveillance improvements, marking a positive public health outcome.\n\nQID: Management-table-271-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-271-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the mathematical relationship and provides plausible biological and reporting implications for the decreasing multiplier.

Provide a step-by-step mathematical explanation.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo determine when an employee $i$ in block $k$ has exactly met the minimum shift requirement, we analyze the variables step-by-step:\n\n1. Let $S_{ik}$ be the number of shifts assigned to employee $i$ in block $k$, and $R_{ik}$ be the minimum shift requirement for employee $i$ in block $k$.\n\n2. The variable $O_{ik}$ is defined as the difference between the min shift requirement and the number of shifts assigned:\n   $$O_{ik} = R_{ik} - S_{ik}$$\n\n3. The employee has exactly met the minimum shift requirement when $S_{ik} = R_{ik}$. Substituting into the equation for $O_{ik}$:\n   $$O_{ik} = R_{ik} - R_{ik} = 0$$\n\n4. The variable $\\theta_{ik}$ is 1 if the employee has met or exceeded the min shift requirement:\n   $$\\theta_{ik} = 1 \\text{ when } S_{ik} \\geq R_{ik}$$\n   Since $S_{ik} = R_{ik}$ in this case, $\\theta_{ik} = 1$.\n\n5.

For example, if the vertices are $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$, then any convex combination $h = (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3)$ must have $\\alpha_i$ integral, which is only possible if three of the $\\alpha_i$ are zero and one is 1.\n3. **Use Volume Argument**: The volume of the tetrahedron formed by the vertices must be $1/6$ if it is an integral polyhedron. The volume can be computed using the determinant formula: $$V = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\det \\begin{bmatrix} v^1 & v^2 & v^3 & v^4 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right|.$$ If $V > 1/6$, the polyhedron cannot be integral.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Verify edges are primitive. For each edge between vertices, calculate gcd(dx, dy) where dx, dy are coordinate differences. If all edges have gcd = 1, there are no intermediate lattice points.\n\nStep 2: Apply Pick's theorem. Compute polygon area via determinant (given βq - γp = 1 guarantees area = 1 when quadrilateral). Count boundary points B (vertices + edge points). Since edges are primitive, B = 4 (only vertices). Then Area = 1 = I + B/2 - 1 → I = 0 confirms no interior points.\n\nStep 3: Confirm matrix A's constraints.

Use the definition of stability where no firm-worker pair prefers each other over their current assignments.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo verify the stability of M1, we must ensure no blocking pair exists. Let's examine each firm and worker:\n\n1. Firm 1 is assigned {b, c, d}, its top choice. No worker in {b, c, d} can form a blocking pair since they are already with their first choice firm (1).\n2. Firm 2 is assigned {a, e}. Worker a's preferred firms are 2,3,4 (from the table), and a is already with firm 2, its top choice. Worker e is assigned to firm 2, which is its second choice (prefers firm 1 first). However, firm 1 is already at capacity with its top choices, so no blocking pair here.\n3. Firm 3 is assigned {a, f}. Worker a is already with firm 2, its top choice, so won't form a blocking pair with 3. Worker f is assigned to firm 3, which is its first choice (from the table).\n4. Firm 4 is assigned {j}, which is its top choice.\n5. Firm 5 is assigned {h}, its top choice.\n6. Firm 6 is assigned {i}, its top choice.\n7. Firm 7 is assigned {g}, its top choice.\n\nNo worker can form a blocking pair with any firm that they prefer over their current assignment, as either the firm is already at capacity with better options or the worker is already with their top choice. Thus, M1 is stable.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify current assignments in matching M1:\n- Firm 1: {b, c, d}\n- Firm 2: {a, e}\n- Firm 3: {a, f}\n- Firm 4: {j}\n- Firm 5: {h}\n- Firm 6: {i}\n- Firm 7: {g}\n\nStep 2: Analyze firm preferences from context:\n- Firm 1 prefers {a, b} > {a, d} but currently has {b, c, d}. Worker a is assigned to Firms 2/3.\n\nStep 3: Check worker preferences:\n- Worker a is already at Firms 2/3 (their preferred firms based on table structure).\n- Workers b, c, d are at Firm 1 (their top preference from firm 1's list).\n- Workers e, f, g, h, i, j show no indication of preferring other firms over their current assignments.\n\nStep 4: Verify critical pairs:\n- (1, a): Firm 1 wants a but worker a prefers current firms 2/3\n- (2/3, b): Workers b/c/d prefer Firm 1\n- Other workers show no mutual preference improvements\n\nStep 5: Conclusion:\nNo firm-worker pair mutually prefers each other over current assignments.

For the dominance market (1), the production values are 171, 150, 173 (in 1000 units). For the perfect competition market (3), the production values are 684, 718, 792 (in 1000 units).

Provide step-by-step calculations.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the optimal $s_0$:\n1. From Table 1, identify cumulative probabilities for each $s_0$:\n   - $s_0=0$: $P(X\\leq0)=1.000$\n   - $s_0=1$: $P(X\\leq1)=0.621$\n   - $s_0=2$: $P(X\\leq2)=0.333$\n   - $s_0=3$: $P(X\\leq3)=0.154$\n   - $s_0=4$: $P(X\\leq4)=0.022$\n   - $s_0=5$: $P(X\\leq5)=0.0017$\n   - $s_0=6$: $P(X\\leq6)\\approx0.0004$\n\n2. The optimality condition requires $P(X\\leq s_0)\\geq1.1$. \n3. Only $s_0=0$ satisfies $1.000\\geq1.1$ which is impossible (contradiction).\n4. Thus, the optimal $s_0$ is the smallest value where $P(X\\leq s_0)$ is maximized below 1.1, which is $s_0=0$ (though the condition cannot be strictly satisfied, indicating the need for budget adjustment).\n\nThis shows the algorithm would need to adjust $\\gamma$ or $g'$ to achieve feasibility.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the required condition from the formula context. The optimal depot stock level s₀ must satisfy ∑ₓ=0^s p(x|θD=2.4) ≥ 1 + γcⱼ/rᵢ = 1.1.\nStep 2: Recognize that standard Poisson cumulative probabilities cannot exceed 1. This suggests either a misalignment in the formula or an interpretation where the actual target is 1 - γcⱼ/rᵢ = 0.9 (common in inventory critical fractile analysis).\nStep 3: Use the table to find the smallest s₀ where the cumulative probability meets/exceeds 0.9. The s=4 row shows values 0.022 and 20.088.

Job $n+1$ has $t_{1,n+1}=T$ and $t_{2,n+1}=T$, while job $n+2$ has $t_{1,n+2}=2T$ and $t_{2,n+2}=0$.\n3. **Schedule jobs $n+1$ and $n+2$**: The schedule must ensure that job $n+1$ is processed on $P_1$ from time $0$ to $T$ and on $P_2$ from time $T$ to $2T$. Job $n+2$ is processed on $P_1$ from time $2T$ to $4T$, but since $t_{2,n+2}=0$, it does not use $P_2$.\n4. **Check for partition**: The jobs $1$ through $n$ can be scheduled without violating the no-wait condition if and only if the set $S=\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ has a partition. This means there exists a subset $S' \\subseteq S$ such that $\\sum_{a_i \\in S'} a_i = \\sum_{a_i \\notin S'} a_i$.\n5. **Conclusion**: If such a partition exists, then the no-wait schedule with finish time $\\tau=3T$ is feasible. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the job structure. The first n jobs have t₁,i=0 and t₂,i=a_i. Job n+1 has both tasks = T, and job n+2 has t₁=2T, t₂=0. Total allowed time τ=3T.\nStep 2: Recognize that in a no-wait flow shop, job order must be identical on both processors. Processor 1 sequence determines processor 2 sequence.\nStep 3: Consider scheduling order. The critical path requires job n+2's 2T processor 1 time and job n+1's T processor 2 time to fit within 3T.\nStep 4: Optimal sequence must be jobs 1-n → n+1 → n+2. This allows processor 1 to complete at 3T (0→T for n+1, T→3T for n+2).\nStep 5: Processor 2 must handle jobs 1-n (total Σa_i) before starting n+1 at exactly T to meet no-wait constraints. This requires Σa_i ≤ T.\nConclusion: A valid schedule exists if and only if the sum of all a_i values is ≤ T.\n\nQID: Management-table-531-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-531-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies key scheduling constraints and the importance of job ordering, but incorrectly concludes that Σa_i ≤ T is sufficient.

Use the demand data: Annacotty (15), Bunratty (10), Carrigaline (20), Macroom (25), Mallow (30), Rathduff (18).\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Define the cost function for each tanker type.

Next use 4600 gal (2 available):\n   - Allocate to Mallow's remaining 10k: 2 tankers cover 9,200 → remaining 800.\n\n3. Use 4500 gal (6 available):\n   - Macroom (25k): 5 tankers (22,500) → remaining 2,500.\n   - Carrigaline (20k): 4 tanks → 18,000 → remaining 2,000.\n\n4.

Specify the degrees of the SOS and non-SOS terms in the certificate.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz states that if $f > 0$ on $S(g)$ and $S(g)$ is compact with $g_j \\leq 1$, then $f = \\sum_{\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{N}^m} c_{\\alpha \\beta} \\prod_{j=1}^m g_j^{\\alpha_j} (1 - g_j)^{\\beta_j}$, where $c_{\\alpha \\beta} \\geq 0$. For our problem, $m=2$ with $g_1 = 1 - x_1^2 - x_2^2$ and $g_2 = 1 - x_1^4 - x_2^4$. A certificate for $f$ is: $$f = c_{00} + c_{10} g_1 + c_{01} g_2 + c_{20} g_1^2 + c_{11} g_1 g_2 + c_{02} g_2^2 + \\text{higher-order terms},$$ where $c_{\\alpha \\beta} \\geq 0$. The degrees are constrained by $\\deg(f) = 6$. For example, $g_1^2$ has degree 4, $g_1 g_2$ has degree 6, and $g_2^2$ has degree 8. Thus, the highest-degree term in the certificate is $g_2^2$ (degree 8), but for practical computation, we truncate the series to terms with $\\deg(\\prod g_j^{\\alpha_j} (1 - g_j)^{\\beta_j}) \\leq 6$, yielding a finite sum with $c_{00}, c_{10}, c_{01}, c_{20}, c_{11} \\geq 0$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Verify the conditions for Krivine-Stengle. The set S(g) is compact, and constraints g₁ = 1 - x₁² - x₂² ≥ 0, g₂ = 1 - x₁⁴ - x₂⁴ ≥ 0 satisfy g_j ≤ 1 on S(g).\nStep 2: Express f using the Krivine-Stengle certificate. Since f > 0 on S(g), it can be written as a sum of products of g₁, (1 - g₁), g₂, (1 - g₂) with non-negative coefficients. Here, (1 - g₁) = x₁² + x₂² (SOS degree 2) and (1 - g₂) = x₁⁴ + x₂⁴ (SOS degree 4).\nStep 3: Analyze f = x₁⁶ + x₂⁶ - 3x₁²x₂² + 1. To match degree 6, terms like g₁³ (non-SOS degree 6) or combinations like g₁²(1 - g₁) (non-SOS degree 4, SOS degree 2) are needed. The highest SOS term is (1 - g₂)(1 - g₁) (degree 6).\nStep 4: Specify degrees. The certificate contains SOS terms up to degree 6 (e.g., (1 - g₁)³) and non-SOS terms up to degree 6 (e.g., g₁³ or g₁g₂).

Step 2: The elasticity formula simplifies to $\\epsilon_{\\Pi, CR} = \\frac{13,500 / \\Pi}{0 / CR}$, which is undefined. This indicates that elasticity cannot be computed for the base case where cargo rates are unchanged.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the given values. For Case 1, the midpoint profit increase ΔΠ = $13,500. The cargo rate (CR) is provided as CR, but the absolute value of CR is not specified.\n\nStep 2: The elasticity formula is ε_{Π, CR} = (ΔΠ / Π) / (ΔCR / CR).

Verify your calculation using the inventory update equation $Y_{t+1}=Y_{t}+X_{t}-{\\hat{d}}_{t}$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: From Table 5, for year 1965, Order ($X_{1965}$) = 816 and Inventory ($Y_{1965}$) is not directly given but can be inferred. Assuming $Y_{1965}$ is the starting inventory, and given $Y_{1966}$ is not provided, we use the update equation. However, since exact demand ($\\hat{d}_{1965}$) is not provided, we proceed with the given data. If $Y_{1965} = 1$ (from 1964 ending inventory), and $\\hat{d}_{1965} = X_{1965} - (Y_{1966} - Y_{1965})$, but lacking $Y_{1966}$, we assume $Y_{1965+1} = Y_{1966} = 1 + 816 - \\hat{d}_{1965}$. Without exact demand, we approximate $Y_{1965+1} \\approx 1$ (as inventory remains low). Thus, carrying cost $= 0.15 \\times 10 \\times 1 = 1.5$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the required values for 1965 from the table. The order quantity (Xₜ) for 1965 is 816. The starting inventory (Yₜ) for 1965 is the ending inventory from 1964, which is 1 (from the Inventory column for 1964).\n\nStep 2: Apply the inventory carrying cost formula: Iₜ × C × Yₜ₊₁. Given Iₜ = 0.15, C = 10, and Yₜ₊₁ (ending inventory for 1965) needs to be calculated.\n\nStep 3: Use the inventory update equation Yₜ₊₁ = Yₜ + Xₜ − d̂ₜ. However, demand (d̂ₜ) is not explicitly provided. Since the table shows no Inventory value for 1965 or 1966, we assume continuity from 1964's ending inventory (Yₜ = 1) and no excess demand beyond the order quantity. Thus, Yₜ₊₁ ≈ 1 (carried forward).\n\nStep 4: Calculate the carrying cost: 0.15 × 10 × 1 = 1.5.

Given the metric $g_{\\mathbf{U}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{U}}, \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\theta_{\\mathbf{U}}^{\\top} \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}})$, derive the projection operator onto the tangent space.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe projection operator onto the tangent space $T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$ can be derived as follows: 1) Any tangent vector $\\theta_{\\mathbf{U}} \\in T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$ can be decomposed as $\\theta_{\\mathbf{U}} = \\mathbf{U} \\Omega + \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp} \\mathbf{D}$, where $\\Omega = -\\Omega^{\\top}$ and $\\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}$ is the orthogonal complement of $\\mathbf{U}$. 2) The projection of a vector $\\eta_{\\mathbf{U}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times r}$ onto $T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$ is given by $P_{T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)}(\\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}) = \\mathbf{U} \\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}) + (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{U}^{\\top}) \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}$, where $\\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{X}) = (\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{X}^{\\top})/2$. 3) To incorporate the metric $g_{\\mathbf{U}}$, we need to ensure that the projection is orthogonal with respect to this metric. 4) The metric-compatible projection is $P_{T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)}(\\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}) = \\mathbf{U} \\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet}) + (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{U}^{\\top}) \\eta_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet}^{-1}$. This ensures that $g_{\\mathbf{U}}(P_{T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)}(\\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}), \\theta_{\\mathbf{U}}) = g_{\\mathbf{U}}(\\eta_{\\mathbf{U}}, \\theta_{\\mathbf{U}})$ for all $\\theta_{\\mathbf{U}} \\in T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall the tangent space structure of the Stiefel manifold at U: $T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$ consists of vectors $\\mathbf{U}\\Omega + \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}\\mathbf{D}$ where $\\Omega$ is skew-symmetric and $\\mathbf{D}$ is arbitrary. The given metric is $g_{\\mathbf{U}}(\\theta, \\eta) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\theta^{\\top} \\eta)$.\n\nStep 2: To find the projection $\\Pi(\\xi)$ of an ambient vector $\\xi$, decompose it into tangential components $\\mathbf{U}\\Omega_\\xi + \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}\\mathbf{D}_\\xi$. The projection must satisfy $g_{\\mathbf{U}}(\\Pi(\\xi), \\eta) = g_{\\mathbf{U}}(\\xi, \\eta)$ for all $\\eta \\in T_{\\mathbf{U}} \\mathsf{St}(r,p)$.\n\nStep 3: For the $\\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}\\mathbf{D}$ component, solve $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\mathbf{D}_\\xi^{\\top} \\mathbf{D}') = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\xi^{\\top} \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp} \\mathbf{D}')$ for all $\\mathbf{D}'$. This yields $\\mathbf{D}_\\xi = \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}^{\\top} \\xi$, giving the vertical component $\\mathbf{U}_{\\perp} \\mathbf{U}_{\\perp}^{\\top} \\xi$.\n\nStep 4: For the $\\mathbf{U}\\Omega$ component, solve $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\Omega_\\xi^{\\top} \\Omega') = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\xi^{\\top} \\mathbf{U} \\Omega')$ for all skew-symmetric $\\Omega'$. This leads to the Sylvester equation $\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\Omega_\\xi + \\Omega_\\xi \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} = \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet} \\xi^{\\top} \\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\xi \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet}$.\n\nStep 5: The solution requires skew-symmetrization adjusted by the metric weight. The horizontal component becomes $\\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet}^{-1} \\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\xi \\mathbf{V}_{\\bullet}) = \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\xi)$, where $\\text{Skew}(A) = \\frac{1}{2}(A - A^{\\top})$.\n\nFinal Projection: Combining both components, the projection operator is:\n$$\\Pi(\\xi) = \\mathbf{U} \\text{Skew}(\\mathbf{U}^{\\top} \\xi) + (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{U}^{\\top}) \\xi$$\n\nQID: Management-table-478-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-478-1\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the structure of the tangent space and the projection components but fails to fully incorporate the metric $g_{\\\\mathbf{U}}$ in the final projection operator.

Formulate a regression model to predict t(lp) based on m, and discuss the goodness of fit.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo analyze the relationship between m and t(lp), we can perform a linear regression. Let's denote m as the independent variable and t(lp) as the dependent variable. The regression model can be written as:\n\n$t(lp) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 m + \\epsilon$\n\nUsing the data points from Table 4:\n- For CS1: m = 90, t(lp) = 8.53\n- For CS2: m = 63, t(lp) = 84.50\n- For CS3: m = 111, t(lp) = 314.93\n- For CS4: m = 200, t(lp) = 418.86\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean of m and t(lp):\n$\\bar{m} = (90 + 63 + 111 + 200) / 4 = 116$\n$\\bar{t(lp)} = (8.53 + 84.50 + 314.93 + 418.86) / 4 = 206.705$\n\nNext, we calculate the covariance and variance:\n$Cov(m, t(lp)) = \\frac{\\sum (m_i - \\bar{m})(t(lp)_i - \\bar{t(lp)})}{n} = 15,678.98$\n$Var(m) = \\frac{\\sum (m_i - \\bar{m})^2}{n} = 2,881.5$\n\nNow, we can estimate the coefficients:\n$\\beta_1 = Cov(m, t(lp)) / Var(m) = 15,678.98 / 2,881.5 \\approx 5.44$\n$\\beta_0 = \\bar{t(lp)} - \\beta_1 \\bar{m} = 206.705 - 5.44 \\times 116 \\approx -424.935$\n\nThus, the regression equation is:\n$t(lp) = -424.935 + 5.44 m$\n\nTo assess the goodness of fit, we calculate the R-squared value:\n$SS_{total} = \\sum (t(lp)_i - \\bar{t(lp)})^2 = 38,073.47$\n$SS_{res} = \\sum (t(lp)_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 m_i))^2 = 6,732.47$\n$R^2 = 1 - SS_{res} / SS_{total} = 1 - 6,732.47 / 38,073.47 \\approx 0.823$\n\nAn R-squared value of 0.823 indicates that 82.3% of the variability in t(lp) can be explained by the number of rows (m), suggesting a strong linear relationship.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Extract relevant data from Table 4\n- m (rows): [90, 63, 111, 200]\n- t(lp) (time): [8.53, 84.50, 314.93, 418.86] seconds\n\nStep 2: Observe relationship trends\nThe data shows non-linear characteristics:\n- CS2 (m=63) has higher time than CS1 (m=90)\n- Significant time jump between CS2 (m=63) and CS3 (m=111)\n\nStep 3: Perform linear regression analysis\nRegression equation: t(lp) = -110.67 + 2.736m\nCalculated R² = 0.711\n\nStep 4: Evaluate model limitations\n1. Negative intercept suggests model breakdown at small m values\n2. Poor prediction for CS1 (predicted 135.57s vs actual 8.53s)\n3. Small sample size (n=4) limits statistical significance\n\nStep 5: Suggest alternative approaches\nA quadratic model t(lp) = -1767 + 43.56m - 0.116m² shows better trend fitting but still suffers from:\n- Limited data points\n- Potential confounding variables (n columns, matrix density)\n\nStep 6: Discuss goodness of fit\nWhile R² = 0.711 suggests moderate correlation:\n- Residual analysis shows significant errors\n- Actual problem complexity depends on multiple factors beyond just row count\n- Model should be used cautiously for prediction without considering other variables\n\nQID: Management-table-794-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-794-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies non-linear trends and performs a linear regression, but their regression coefficients and R² value differ from the gold answer.

For any incomparable pair $(i, j) \\notin D$, the processing time $p_i \\leq 1/k^{\\lceil b \\rceil}$ and weight $w_j \\leq k^{\\lceil c \\rceil}$, where $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$ are the interval representations of jobs $i$ and $j$, respectively. If $i$ and $j$ are incomparable, $p_i \\cdot w_j \\leq 1/k$ because $p_i \\cdot w_j \\geq k$ would imply $b < c$, making $i$ and $j$ comparable. Since $k = n^2 + 1$, the total contribution of all such pairs is less than $n^2 \\cdot (1/k) < 1$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Analyze the structure of set D and job intervals. D includes parent-child pairs in tree T, (s_i, m_i), (m_i, e_i), and non-tree edge-related pairs. Incomparable pairs not in D must be identified.\nStep 2: Examine job processing times (p_i) and weights (w_j). Key jobs: Sj (p=1/(k j), w=k parent(j)), m_i (p=1/(k(|V|+i)), w=k i), and b_ij (p=1/(k j), w=k i).\nStep 3: Consider incomparable pairs between m_i and m_j. Their intervals overlap but are not nested. Sum contributions: For i < j, p_i w_j + p_j w_i = j/(|V|+i) + i/(|V|+j).\nStep 4: Bound the sum using properties of harmonic series and graph parameters. Since each term j/(|V|+i) < 1 and sum over |V|^2 terms is controlled by denominator growth, total sum accumulates to less than 1.\nStep 5: Other job pairs (Sj, m_i, b_ij) not in D contribute negligible terms due to reciprocal scaling of p_i and w_j. Combined with m_i-m_j terms, total sum remains below 1.\nConclusion: Strategic interval assignments and reciprocal p_i-w_j relationships ensure ∑_{(i,j)∈inc(I)∖D} p_i w_j < 1.\n\nQID: Management-table-625-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-625-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies and analyzes the incomparable job pairs not in D, providing a detailed breakdown of processing times and weights, and concludes with a valid bound showing the sum is less than 1, aligning with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-625-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies and analyzes the incomparable job pairs not in D, providing a detailed breakdown of processing times and weights, and concludes with a valid bound showing the sum is less than 1, aligning with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-625-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies and analyzes the incomparable job pairs not in D, providing a detailed breakdown of processing times and weights, and concludes with a valid bound showing the sum is less than 1, aligning with the gold answer."}

Ensure the consistency inequalities are satisfied.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Assign unnormalized weights satisfying the inequalities. Let $f_{A} = 100$, $f_{C1} = 20$ (since $f_{A} > f_{C1}$ and $f_{B1} > f_{C1}$), and $f_{E} = 1$. Step 2: Compute the sum of unnormalized weights: $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} f_i = f_A + 2f_{C1} + 2f_E = 100 + 2 \\times 20 + 2 \\times 1 = 142$.

Consistency inequalities require f_A > all other f_i, and in C1's hierarchy: A > B1 > C1 > D1 > E.\n\nStep 2: Assign minimal valid values to satisfy inequalities. To ensure A > B1 > C1 and C1 > D1 > E, set D1 = 2 (just above E=1), then C1 must be > D1. Let f_C1 = 3 (next logical integer). B1 must be > C1; set B1 = 4.\n\nStep 3: Calculate total weight sum.

Use the distances provided and assume the route starts and ends at the manufacturer's plant (denoted as '0').\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total distance for the route 0 → 1 → 3 → 5 → 7 → 0, we sum the distances between consecutive nodes as follows:\n1. Distance from 0 to 1: $29,800$\n2. Distance from 1 to 3: $8,550$\n3. Distance from 3 to 5: $9,470$\n4.

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-478-2", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nFor the manifold $\\mathbb{S}_{+}(r)$ of symmetric positive definite matrices, the tangent space at $\\mathbf{B}$ is $T_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbb{S}_{+}(r) = \\mathbb{S}^{r \\times r}$. Given the metric $g_{\\mathbf{B}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}}, \\eta_{\\mathbf{B}}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}} \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{-1} \\eta_{\\mathbf{B}})$, derive the expression for the exponential map on $\\mathbb{S}_{+}(r)$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe exponential map on $\\mathbb{S}_{+}(r)$ with respect to the metric $g_{\\mathbf{B}}$ can be derived as follows: 1) The exponential map at $\\mathbf{B}$ maps a tangent vector $\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\in T_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbb{S}_{+}(r)$ to a point on $\\mathbb{S}_{+}(r)$. 2) For the standard metric $\\text{tr}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{B}^{-1} \\eta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{B}^{-1})$, the exponential map is given by $\\text{Exp}_{\\mathbf{B}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}}) = \\mathbf{B}^{1/2} \\exp(\\mathbf{B}^{-1/2} \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{B}^{-1/2}) \\mathbf{B}^{1/2}$. 3) For the given metric $g_{\\mathbf{B}}$, we need to adjust the exponential map to account for the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}$. 4) The metric $g_{\\mathbf{B}}$ can be interpreted as a scaled inner product, and the exponential map becomes $\\text{Exp}_{\\mathbf{B}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}}) = \\mathbf{B}^{1/2} \\exp(\\mathbf{B}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{-1/2} \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{B}^{-1/2}) \\mathbf{B}^{1/2}$. This ensures that the geodesic distance induced by $g_{\\mathbf{B}}$ is consistent with the exponential map.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Recall that the exponential map on a Riemannian manifold satisfies the geodesic equation defined by the given metric. For symmetric positive definite matrices with metric \\( g_{\\mathbf{B}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}}, \\eta_{\\mathbf{B}}) = \\text{tr}(\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}} \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{-1} \\eta_{\\mathbf{B}}) \\), we analyze the structure.\n\nStep 2: Notice that if \\( \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}} \\) is constant (not dependent on \\( \\mathbf{B} \\)), the metric becomes a weighted Euclidean metric. A change of variables \\( \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{1/2} \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{1/2} \\) transforms the tangent vectors to \\( \\theta_{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{1/2} \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}}^{1/2} \\). In these coordinates, the metric reduces to the standard Euclidean form \\( \\text{tr}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{C}} \\eta_{\\mathbf{C}}) \\).\n\nStep 3: Geodesics in the transformed coordinates are straight lines: \\( \\mathbf{C}(t) = \\mathbf{C}(0) + t\\theta_{\\mathbf{C}} \\). Reverting to the original coordinates gives \\( \\mathbf{B}(t) = \\mathbf{B} + t\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\).\n\nStep 4: Thus, under the given metric with constant \\( \\mathbf{W}_{\\mathbf{B}} \\), the exponential map is the Euclidean addition: \\( \\text{Exp}_{\\mathbf{B}}(\\theta_{\\mathbf{B}}) = \\mathbf{B} + \\theta_{\\mathbf{B}} \\).

{"script_processing_qid": "Management-table-39-0", "llm_grader_input_prompt_user": "\nQUESTION:\nGiven the trend directions in Table 1, derive a mathematical expression for the cost difference $\\Delta C$ between expendable and repairable satellites as a function of satellite mass $m$ and transportation efficiency $\\eta$. Assume that the cost to LEO is $c_{LEO}$ and the modularization mass penalty is $\\delta$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive $\\Delta C(m, \\eta)$, we consider the cost components for both satellite types. For expendable satellites, the total cost $C_e$ includes RDT&E, investment, and launch costs, all of which are functions of mass: $C_e = f(m) + c_{LEO} \\cdot m$. For repairable satellites, the cost $C_r$ includes similar components but adjusted for modularization and transportation efficiency: $C_r = f(m \\cdot (1 - \\delta)) + \\frac{c_{LEO} \\cdot m \\cdot (1 - \\delta)}{\\eta}$. The cost difference is then $\\Delta C = C_e - C_r = f(m) - f(m \\cdot (1 - \\delta)) + c_{LEO} \\cdot m \\left(1 - \\frac{1 - \\delta}{\\eta}\\right)$. This shows how $\\Delta C$ depends on $m$, $\\eta$, $\\delta$, and $c_{LEO}$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify key parameters from the table. Satellite mass (m) increases ΔC, transportation efficiency (η) increases ΔC (favors repairable), and modularization penalty (δ) decreases ΔC. Cost to LEO is c_LEO.\n\nStep 2: Model transportation costs. Expendable satellite transportation cost = (m c_LEO)/η. Repairable satellite has added mass penalty δ, so its transportation cost = ((m + δ) c_LEO)/η.\n\nStep 3: Compute cost difference ΔC = C_e - C_r. Assume production costs differ linearly with mass. Let production cost rates be k_e (expendable) and k_r (repairable).\n\nStep 4: ΔC = [(m c_LEO)/η + k_e m] - [((m + δ) c_LEO)/η + k_r (m + δ)].\n\nStep 5: Simplify to ΔC = -δ c_LEO/η + m(k_e - k_r) - k_r δ.\n\nStep 6: From trend analysis, k_e > k_r (expendable costs increase faster). Dominant terms yield ΔC ≈ (m c_LEO)/η - (δ c_LEO)/η = c_LEO/η (m - δ).\n\nFinal Expression: ΔC = c_LEO/η (m - δ).

Use the loss values from the table.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we analyze each player's best response to the others' strategies. For Player 1, if Players 2 and 3 choose $(1,1)$, Player 1's losses are 1 (strategy 1) and 8 (strategy 2). Thus, Player 1 prefers strategy 1. Similarly, for Player 2, if Players 1 and 3 choose $(1,1)$, the losses are 2 (strategy 1) and 8 (strategy 2), so Player 2 prefers strategy 1. For Player 3, if Players 1 and 2 choose $(1,1)$, the losses are 4 (strategy 1) and 8 (strategy 2), so Player 3 prefers strategy 1. Thus, $(1,1,1)$ is a Nash equilibrium with losses $(1, 2, 4)$.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understand the table structure. Rows represent (player, strategy) pairs, and columns represent opponents' strategies.

Calculate the new utilization $\\rho$ for the distribution stage, assuming the service rate $\\mu$ remains unchanged from the original model.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the new utilization $\\rho$ for the distribution stage:\n\n1. First, determine the arrival rate $\\lambda$ using Little's Law for the new scenario:\n   - $L = 21$ policies, $W = 0.5$ days,\n   - $\\lambda = \\frac{L}{W} = \\frac{21}{0.5} = 42$ policies per day.\n\n2. Assume the service rate $\\mu$ for the distribution stage is the same as in the original model. From the original model, $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}$. Using $\\lambda \\approx 39.05$ and $\\rho = 1$ (since the original model is at full utilization),\n   - $\\mu \\approx 39.05$ policies per day.\n\n3. For the new scenario, $\\lambda = 42$ policies per day,\n   - $\\rho = \\frac{42}{39.05} \\approx 1.076$.\n\nSince $\\rho > 1$, this suggests the system is unstable under the new arrival rate, indicating an inconsistency or the need for recalibration.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Calculate the new arrival rate (λ) using Little's Law. Total policies in process (L) = 21, lead time (W) = 0.5 days. λ = L / W = 21 / 0.5 = 42 policies/day.\nStep 2: Determine the original service rate (μ) for the distribution stage. From the original model, L_distribution = 16 policies. Using Little's Law for M/M/1 queues: 16 = λ_original * (1 / (μ - λ_original)). Original λ = 82 total policies / 2.1 days ≈ 39.0476/day. Solve for μ: 16 = 39.0476 / (μ - 39.0476) → μ ≈ 41.488/day.\nStep 3: Calculate new utilization ρ = λ_new / μ_original = 42 / 41.488 ≈ 1.012 (101.2%).

Use the equilibrium condition $\\alpha \\cdot \\partial T/\\partial t + \\alpha_2 \\cdot \\partial D/\\partial t = 0$, where $T$ is trip time and $D$ is schedule delay.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nStep 1: For Case 1 ($\\alpha = 10$), the equilibrium condition is $10 \\cdot \\partial T/\\partial t + 2 \\cdot \\partial D/\\partial t = 0$.\nStep 2: For Case 3 ($\\alpha = 3$), it becomes $3 \\cdot \\partial T/\\partial t + 2 \\cdot \\partial D/\\partial t = 0$.\nStep 3: At $t = 0$, assume $\\partial T/\\partial t$ and $\\partial D/\\partial t$ are similar initially. Then, Case 1 implies $\\partial D/\\partial t = -5 \\partial T/\\partial t$, while Case 3 implies $\\partial D/\\partial t = -1.5 \\partial T/\\partial t$.\nStep 4: Thus, Case 3 has a lower initial departure rate $\\lambda(0)$ because users are less sensitive to trip time ($\\alpha$ is smaller), leading to a flatter $\\lambda(t)$ curve initially.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: The equilibrium condition is α·∂T/∂t + α₂·∂D/∂t = 0. For late arrivals, schedule delay D(t) = t + T(t), so ∂D/∂t = 1 + ∂T/∂t. Substituting gives (α + α₂)∂T/∂t + α₂ = 0 → ∂T/∂t = -α₂/(α + α₂).\n\nStep 2: Trip time T = 1/u, where speed u = u_m(1 - k/k_j). Using k_j = 220 veh/mile and λ = u_mk(1 - k/k_j), solve for k in terms of λ.\n\nStep 3: Substitute k into T = 1/[u_m(1 - k/220)] to express T in terms of λ. Differentiate T with respect to t, accounting for λ's dependence on t.\n\nStep 4: Using ∂T/∂t = -α₂/(α + α₂), solve for λ at t=0. For Case 1 (α=10), ∂T/∂t = -2/(10+2) = -1/6. For Case 3 (α=3), ∂T/∂t = -2/(3+2) = -2/5.\n\nStep 5: The larger magnitude of ∂T/∂t in Case 3 implies a faster adjustment in trip time, leading to a higher equilibrium departure rate λ(0) compared to Case 1.

For the optimal profits: $NPV_{optimal} = \\frac{-3.1}{1.18} + \\frac{20.2}{1.18^2} + \\frac{7.3}{1.18^3} + \\frac{14.0}{1.18^4} + \\frac{16.8}{1.18^5} + \\frac{20.3}{1.18^6} + \\frac{14.0}{1.18^7} + \\frac{5.2}{1.18^8} + \\frac{9.1}{1.18^9} + \\frac{7.9}{1.18^{10}} + \\frac{4.7}{1.18^{11}}$. Similarly, for the actual profits: $NPV_{actual} = \\sum_{t=1}^{11} \\frac{Profit_t}{(1.18)^t}$. The difference $NPV_{optimal} - NPV_{actual}$ shows the value of the optimal policy.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Identify the cash flows. The optimal profits are [7.1, 11.3, 10.7, 10.0, 10.5, 8.4, 8.5, 7.6, 7.0, 4.8, 5.6] (in millions) for years 58–68. Actual profits are [-3.1, 20.2, 7.3, 14.0, 16.8, 20.3, 14.0, 5.2, 9.1, 7.9, 4.7].\n\nStep 2: Calculate discount factors. With a 18% cost of capital, the discount factor for year \\( n \\) is \\( 1/(1.18)^{n} \\). Years 58–68 correspond to discount exponents 1–11 respectively.\n\nStep 3: Compute NPV for optimal policy. For each year \\( t \\), divide optimal profit by \\( (1.18)^{(t-57)} \\). Sum results:\n≈7.1/1.18 + 11.3/1.18² + ... +5.6/1.18¹¹ ≈ ~38.9 million.\n\nStep 4: Compute NPV for actual profits. Repeat process for actual cash flows:\n≈-3.1/1.18 + 20.2/1.18² + ... +4.7/1.18¹¹ ≈ ~57.1 million.\n\nStep 5: Compare. Despite lower total undiscounted profits (91.5 vs 116.4), NPV of optimal policy is lower than actual profits’ NPV due to front-loaded discounting effects and higher early-year profits in actual data.\n\nQID: Management-table-721-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-721-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate used incorrect cash flow data for the optimal profits (7.1, 11.3, etc.) instead of the values provided in the gold answer (-3.1, 20.2, etc.), leading to a completely wrong NPV calculation and comparison.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-721-0", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate used incorrect cash flow data for the optimal profits (7.1, 11.3, etc.) instead of the values provided in the gold answer (-3.1, 20.2, etc.), leading to a completely wrong NPV calculation and comparison."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-721-0", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate used incorrect cash flow data for the optimal profits (7.1, 11.3, etc.) instead of the values provided in the gold answer (-3.1, 20.2, etc.), leading to a completely wrong NPV calculation and comparison."}
