This represents a decrease in TOPE by $1.29 when overdraft increases by $100. The rate of change is $\\frac{-1.29}{100} = -0.0129$ per dollar of overdraft.

The small magnitude of $h$ relative to its standard error indicates that any autocorrelation is negligible, aligning with the assumption that $U(t)$ follows $$U(t) = \\rho U(t-1) + \\eta_t$$ where $\\rho$ is close to zero.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's interpret the Durbin h statistic value of -0.308 step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Understanding the Durbin h test\\n- The Durbin h test is specifically designed for autoregressive models with lagged dependent variables\\n- It tests for first-order autocorrelation in the residuals\\n- The null hypothesis is H₀: ρ = 0 (no autocorrelation)\\n- The alternative hypothesis is H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (autocorrelation exists)\\n\\nStep 2: Interpreting the test statistic\\n- The h statistic follows a standard normal distribution\\n- At 5% significance level, the critical values are ±1.96\\n- The calculated h value is -0.308\\n\\nStep 3: Making the statistical decision\\n- Since |-0.308| < 1.96, we fail to reject the null hypothesis\\n- The h value falls well within the acceptance region\\n- This indicates that there is no significant evidence of first-order autocorrelation\\n\\nStep 4: Implications for U(t)\\n- The residuals U(t) appear to be independent over time\\n- The assumption that ρ = 0 in\n\nQID: Management-table-695-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-695-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly interprets the Durbin $h$ statistic value of -0.308, explaining the test's purpose, the decision to fail to reject the null hypothesis, and the implications for the residuals $U(t)$.

Using the cost function $f_{e}(x)$, derive the theoretical upper bound for the competitive ratio of the online algorithm and compare it with the empirical average OLG value of 1.189.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the theoretical upper bound for the competitive ratio, we analyze the cost function $f_{e}(x) = \\sigma_{e} + x^{\\alpha_{e}}$ for $x > 0$.\n\n1. **Competitive Ratio Definition**: The competitive ratio $\\rho$ is defined as the maximum ratio of the online algorithm's cost to the optimal offline cost, i.e., $\\rho = \\frac{\\text{ALG}}{\\text{OPT}}$.\n\n2. **Upper Bound Derivation**: For continuous $\\alpha_{e} \\in [1.1, 3]$, the worst-case competitive ratio occurs when $\\alpha_{e} = 3$ (maximal diseconomies of scale). The fixed cost $\\sigma_{e}$ is chosen from $[1, (0.3 \\times 10)^3] = [1, 27]$.\n   - The online algorithm's cost can be bounded by considering the worst-case scenario where all requests are routed on a single edge, leading to $\\text{ALG} \\leq \\sigma_{e} + N^{\\alpha_{e}} = \\sigma_{e} + 10^{3}$.\n   - The optimal cost $\\text{OPT}$ is at least $\\sigma_{e}$ (if requests are distributed).\n   - Thus, $\\rho \\leq \\frac{\\sigma_{e} + 1000}{\\sigma_{e}} = 1 + \\frac{1000}{\\sigma_{e}}$.\n   - The maximum $\\rho$ occurs when $\\sigma_{e} = 1$, giving $\\rho \\leq 1 + 1000 = 1001$.\n\n3. **Comparison with Empirical Value**: The empirical average OLG is 1.189, which is significantly lower than the theoretical upper bound of 1001. This suggests that in practice, the online algorithm performs much better than the worst-case theoretical bound, likely due to the random distribution of $\\alpha_{e}$ and $\\sigma_{e}$ values and the uniform sampling of request pairs.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's solve this step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the key information\\n- We're looking at the NSF network with 10 request pairs and continuous α values\\n- The empirical result shows Average OLG/OPT = 1.189\\n- For continuous instances (C), αe ∈ [1.1, 3]\\n- The cost function is fe(x) = 0 if x=0, or σe + x^αe if x>0\\n\\nStep 2: Recall the theoretical competitive ratio bound\\n- For cost functions of this form, the theoretical competitive ratio is bounded by:\\n- max{αα/(αα - (α-1)α-1)} where α is the maximum value of αe\\n- In this case, αmax = 3\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the theoretical bound\\n- With α = 3:\\n- Ratio = 33/(33 - 23)\\n- = 27/(27 - 4)\\n- = 27/23\\n- ≈ 1.174\\n\\nStep 4: Compare theoretical and empirical results\\n- Theoretical upper bound: ≈ 1.174\\n- Empirical average OL\n\nQID: Management-table-486-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-486-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the cost function and the range for αe, but the theoretical competitive ratio calculation is incorrect.

Determine the profit increase: $4,900,000 (PPP imperfect forecast) - $4,420,000 (Company Decisions) = $480,000.\n2. Divide the profit increase by the maximum potential profit increase: $480,000 / $720,000 ≈ 0.6667.\n3. Convert to percentage: 0.6667 * 100 ≈ 66.67%.\nThus, PPP achieves approximately 66.67% of the potential profit increase with an imperfect forecast.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's calculate the percentage of potential profit increase for the PPP model with imperfect forecast:\n\nStep 1: Find the actual profit increase achieved by PPP with imperfect forecast\n- PPP profit with imperfect forecast = $4,900,000\n- Company's base profit = $4,420,000\n- Actual profit increase = $4,900,000 - $4,420,000 = $480,000\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage of potential profit increase\n- Maximum potential profit increase = $720,000 (given)\n- Percentage = (Actual profit increase ÷ Maximum potential profit increase) × 100\n- Percentage = ($480,000 ÷ $720,000) × 100\n- Percentage = 0.6667 × 100 = 66.67%\n\nTherefore, the Parametric Production Planning model with an imperfect forecast achieved 66.67% of the maximum potential profit increase.\n\nQID: Management-table-774-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-774-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer matches the gold answer exactly in both calculations and final percentage, demonstrating correct understanding and execution of the problem.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-774-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer matches the gold answer exactly in both calculations and final percentage, demonstrating correct understanding and execution of the problem."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-774-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer matches the gold answer exactly in both calculations and final percentage, demonstrating correct understanding and execution of the problem."}

Relate this to the efficiency of the KL policy.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe stopping boundary $a(n/N)$ dictates the threshold for the KL index $I_i(\\hat{\\theta}_{in}, \\theta_i)$. As $n/N \\to 0$, $a(n/N) \\to \\infty$, making the stopping criterion $I_i(\\hat{\\theta}_{in}, \\theta_i) > n^{-1}a(n/N)$ more stringent.

Interpret the result in the context of bank profitability.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the elasticity, we use the formula: $E = \\frac{\\% \\Delta NSF_{fees}}{\\% \\Delta Overdraft}$. For 'High-low' sequencing, NSF fees increase from $54.64 to $58.04 when overdraft increases from $100 to $200. The percentage change in NSF fees is $\\frac{58.04 - 54.64}{54.64} \\times 100 = 6.22\\%$. The percentage change in overdraft is $\\frac{200 - 100}{100} \\times 100 = 100\\%$. Thus, elasticity $E = \\frac{6.22}{100} = 0.0622$.

For 2 children, the linear predictor changes by $2 \\times -0.359 = -0.718$. The hazard ratio is $\\exp(-0.718) \\approx 0.488$. Since duration is inversely proportional to hazard, the duration ratio is $1 / 0.488 \\approx 2.05$. Thus, the household with 2 children has a home-stay duration approximately 105% longer (or 2.05 times) than a household with no children, all else equal.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant coefficient\n- From the table, we can find the coefficient for 'Number of children 5-15 years of age' is -0.359\n\nStep 2: Calculate the effect for 2 children\n- Since we have 2 children, we multiply the coefficient by 2:\n- Effect = 2 × (-0.359) = -0.718\n\nStep 3: Convert to percentage change\n- In a Weibull duration model, the coefficient represents the effect on log duration\n- To convert to percentage change, we use the formula: [exp(β) - 1] × 100%\n- Percentage change = [exp(-0.718) - 1] × 100%\n- = [0.488 - 1] × 100%\n- = -51.2%\n\nStep 4: Final interpretation\n- A household with 2 children aged 5-15 would be expected to have approximately 51.2% shorter home-stay duration compared to a household with no children, all else being equal.\n\nQID: Management-table-678-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-678-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate incorrectly interpreted the coefficient as affecting duration directly rather than the hazard rate.

How does this duration compare to the total project timeline of 260 days?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total duration for Mill 2: 1. Manufacturing period: December 8, 1980, to June 10, 1981. This is $\\text{June 10, 1981} - \\text{December 8, 1980} = 184 \\text{ days}$. 2. Transport period: June 7, 1981, to August 25, 1981.

Assume the average degree of each node in $G$ is $d$ and the number of aircraft is $|P|$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the computational complexity, we analyze the ASH algorithm step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: For each disrupted aircraft $p^{*}$, initialize $l(p^{*}) = 0$ and $l(p) = \\infty$ for all other aircraft $p \\in P \\setminus \\{p^{*}\\}$. This step takes $O(|P|)$ time.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: ASH performs a BFS-like traversal to find shortest paths from $p^{*}$ to other aircraft. For each aircraft $p$ in the queue, it examines up to $d$ adjacent aircraft. The worst-case time complexity for BFS is $O(|P| + |E|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges. In a dense graph, $|E| = O(|P| \\cdot d)$, so the complexity becomes $O(|P| \\cdot d)$.\n\n3. **Cycle Detection**: Whenever $p^{*}$ is found adjacent to an aircraft $p'$ in the queue, a cycle is detected. The cycle includes all aircraft on the path from $p^{*}$ to $p'$ plus the edge $(p', p^{*})$. The time to detect and process each cycle is proportional to the cycle length, which is bounded by $O(|P|)$.\n\n4. **Termination Condition**: The algorithm terminates when $|P'(p^{*})| \\geq \\text{MINPLANES}$ or all aircraft have been processed. In the worst case, it processes all $|P|$ aircraft.\n\nCombining these steps, the overall complexity is dominated by the BFS traversal, which is $O(|P| \\cdot d)$.

Fleet 1 has 469 flights and 96 planes, so $469 / 96 \\approx 4.885$.\n2. Fleet 2 has 302 flights and 70 planes, so $302 / 70 \\approx 4.314$.\n\nImpact on operational efficiency:\n- A higher average number of flights per plane (as in Fleet 1) indicates more intensive use of each aircraft, which could lead to higher stress on maintenance schedules and a higher likelihood of delays or cancellations if disruptions occur.\n- Under the ARO framework, Fleets with higher utilization rates may benefit more from the delay-tolerant routing, as cancellations are minimized by allowing controlled delays. However, the marginal increase in delays (e.g., for Fleet 3) must be managed to avoid excessive passenger disruptions.\n\nThis ratio directly affects the cancellation rates because fleets with higher utilization (like Fleet 1) may experience more frequent disruptions, but ARO's delay policies can mitigate cancellations by redistributing delays across the network.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's solve this step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Extract the relevant data from Table 4\\nFleet 1: 96 planes, 469 flights\\nFleet 2: 70 planes, 302 flights\\n\\nStep 2: Calculate flights per plane ratio\\nFleet 1: 469 ÷ 96 = 4.89 flights per plane\\nFleet 2: 302 ÷ 70 = 4.31 flights per plane\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze operational efficiency impact\\n- Fleet 1 has a higher utilization rate (4.89 flights/plane vs 4.31 flights/plane)\\n- Higher utilization means:\\n  * Less slack in the system for recovery operations\\n  * Greater vulnerability to propagating delays\\n  * More challenging to implement recovery solutions when disruptions occur\\n\\nStep 4: Impact on ARO framework and cancellation rates\\n- The higher flights-per-plane ratio in Fleet 1 suggests:\\n  * More complex recovery scenarios when disruptions occur\\n  * Greater potential for cascading delays\\n  * Higher likelihood of requiring ARO intervention\\n  * May explain why Fleet 1 requires more computational time (16 seconds per\n\nQID: Management-table-672-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-672-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a thorough analysis of the operational efficiency impact and ARO framework implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-672-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a thorough analysis of the operational efficiency impact and ARO framework implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-672-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the average flights per plane for both fleets and provides a thorough analysis of the operational efficiency impact and ARO framework implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusions."}

'Relaxed ILR (PP)' has Total Cost = $720,411.89 and Total Shipment = 10,957,624 lbs, while 'DD relaxed ILR (PP)' has Total Cost = $717,422.20 and Total Shipment = 10,922,687 lbs. The difference in CPP is due to the marginal changes in cost and shipment weight.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Locate the CPP values\n- Relaxed ILR (PP) has a CPP of $0.05103\n- DD relaxed ILR (PP) has a CPP of $0.05118\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference\n- The difference in CPP is $0.05118 - $0.05103 = $0.00015 per pound\n- This means DD relaxed ILR (PP) costs about 0.015 cents more per pound than Relaxed ILR (PP)\n\nStep 3: Analyze the underlying data\n- Relaxed ILR (PP): 19,056,236.26 lbs total shipment, 462 shipments, $972,441.06 total cost\n- DD relaxed ILR (PP): 19,027,553.37 lbs total shipment, 471 shipments, $973,820.02 total cost\n\nStep 4: Explain the difference\n- DD relaxed ILR (PP) has 9 more shipments than Relaxed ILR (PP)\n- Despite handling slightly less total weight, DD relaxed ILR (PP) costs about $1,379 more in total\n- The higher number of shipments in DD relaxe\n\nQID: Management-table-127-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-127-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer provides incorrect CPP values and underlying data that do not match the gold answer.

Step 2: This policy minimizes NSF charges by ensuring that smaller checks are processed first, reducing the likelihood of larger checks causing an overdraft. Step 3: Since the policy inherently minimizes NSF charges, increasing the overdraft protection does not affect the number of NSF charges because the sequencing order already optimizes for minimal charges. Thus, the average number of NSF charges remains constant regardless of the overdraft protection level.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The average number of NSF charges remains constant at 1.619 across all overdraft protection levels for the low-high sequencing policy due to several key factors:\\n\\nStep 1: Understanding Low-High Sequencing\\n- In low-high sequencing, checks are processed in order from lowest dollar amount to highest dollar amount\\n- This means smaller checks are always processed first before larger ones\\n\\nStep 2: Impact of Processing Order\\n- When account funds are limited, processing smaller checks first maximizes the number of checks that can be paid\\n- This minimizes the number of checks that result in NSF charges\\n\\nStep 3: Why It's Constant\\n- The low-high policy consistently processes the same number of checks in the same order regardless of overdraft protection\\n- When a check would exceed available funds (including overdraft), it results in an NSF charge\\n- Additional overdraft protection only affects whether a check is returned, not whether it triggers an NSF fee\\n\\nStep 4: Mathematical Logic\\n- The NSF charge occurs at the point when available funds are exceeded\\n- Since checks are always processed in the same order (lowest to highest), the point at which funds are exceeded remains the same\\n- The overdraft protection simply changes whether the check is ultimately paid or returned, but doesn't\n\nQID: Management-table-374-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-374-2\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly explains that the low-high sequencing policy processes checks in ascending order, minimizing NSF charges, and that overdraft protection levels do not affect this optimization, keeping the average NSF charges constant.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-374-2", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly explains that the low-high sequencing policy processes checks in ascending order, minimizing NSF charges, and that overdraft protection levels do not affect this optimization, keeping the average NSF charges constant."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-374-2", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly explains that the low-high sequencing policy processes checks in ascending order, minimizing NSF charges, and that overdraft protection levels do not affect this optimization, keeping the average NSF charges constant."}

For thermal units per thermal plant: $\\text{Average thermal units per plant} = \\frac{253}{111} \\approx 2.28$.

The key insight is that generalized weighted Shapley value rules induce potential games, where the potential function $\\Phi$ satisfies $U_{i}(a) - U_{i}(a') = \\lambda_{i} (\\Phi(a) - \\Phi(a'))$ for any unilateral deviation by player $i$.

This negative elasticity suggests strong substitution between transit and car travel in the traditional model.\n\nFor the reverse model (Equation 48), a cross-elasticity of 0.50 implies that a 1% improvement in transit attributes would increase car travel demand by 0.5%. This positive elasticity indicates complementarity between transit and car travel in the reverse model.\n\nThese elasticities influence the total vehicle kilometers of travel by affecting the modal split.

On the boundary, the algorithm can traverse $(t-1)$-simplices where $t < n$, which is more efficient than moving through full-dimensional $n$-simplices.

The CDF is $F(t) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t}$. The probability that the duration exceeds 15 minutes is $P(T > 15) = 1 - F(15) = e^{-\\lambda \\times 15}$.

Use the formula for the expected number of observations $E_{\\theta}\\tau_{N}(i) \\sim \\log(N|\\theta-\\theta_{i}|^{2})/I_{i}(\\theta,\\theta_{i})$ to justify your answer.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the asymptotic behavior of $R_N(\\theta)$, we analyze the efficiency measure $R_N(\\theta) = \\frac{\\widehat{H}_{N}(\\theta)}{H_{N}^{*}(\\theta)}$. For large $N$, the KL policy ensures that the expected number of observations $E_{\\theta}\\tau_{N}(i)$ approaches the minimal required learning $\\log(N|\\theta-\\theta_{i}|^{2})/I_{i}(\\theta,\\theta_{i})$.

Specifically, derive a performance metric $\\eta$ defined as $\\eta = \\frac{\\text{Average Optimality Gap}}{\\text{Average Total Time}}$ and interpret its implications for the heuristic's scalability.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate $\\eta$, we use the values from Table II: the average optimality gap is $0.17\\%$ (0.0017 in decimal) and the average total time is 8380 seconds. Thus, $$\\eta = \\frac{0.0017}{8380} \\approx 2.03 \\times 10^{-7}.$$ This metric indicates the trade-off between solution quality and computational effort.

Step 2: The average number of vehicles saved is the difference between the VRP vehicles and the minimal number of vehicles. Step 3: Let $D$ be the total demand.

The third cumulant, which relates to skewness, is additive. Given the skewness values for Business 1 ($\\gamma_1 = 0.5$) and Business 2 ($\\gamma_2 = 0.8$), the portfolio's total skewness $\\gamma_p$ is calculated as follows:\n\n1. The third cumulant $\\kappa_3$ for each business is related to skewness $\\gamma$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ by $\\kappa_3 = \\gamma \\sigma^3$. Assuming $\\sigma_1 = 1$ and $\\sigma_2 = 1$ for simplicity, $\\kappa_{3,1} = 0.5 \\times 1^3 = 0.5$ and $\\kappa_{3,2} = 0.8 \\times 1^3 = 0.8$.\n2.

Show the step-by-step calculation for the weighted citation from MS to OR.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo derive the weighted citation from MS to OR, we apply the parameters γ and β to the raw citation count. The formula for weighted citations is: $$c_{yx}' = c_{yx} \\times (1 - \\beta)$$ if y = x (self-citation), otherwise $$c_{yx}' = c_{yx} \\times (1 - \\gamma)$$. For MS to OR (y ≠ x), the calculation is: $$72 \\times (1 - 0.2) = 72 \\times 0.8 = 57.6$$. However, the table shows 72.0, indicating no weighting was applied for non-self citations in this context.

Provide a step-by-step calculation and interpret the result in the context of public health policy.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo estimate the additional deaths caused by the DI scenario, we subtract the cumulative deaths in the FP + LT + TR scenario from those in the DI + FP + LT + TR scenario in 2020: $\\Delta N_4 = 1,270,000 - 1,160,000 = 110,000$ deaths. This calculation assumes that the DI scenario's only difference is the drug intervention.

This might seem counterintuitive at first, but can be explained by several factors:\\n\\n- The DI scenario likely keeps people alive longer with HIV/AIDS, which could lead to more opportunities for transmission\\n- While individuals live longer with treatment (which is positive), the longer survival times may result in a larger pool of infected individuals who eventually succumb to the disease\\n- This demonstrates an important public health trade-off: interventions that extend life may also increase the total number of deaths over a longer time period due to population dynamics\\n\\nStep 4: Policy Implications\\nThis finding\n\nQID: Management-table-86-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-86-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly calculates the additional deaths (110,000) and provides a thorough interpretation of the public health implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-86-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the additional deaths (110,000) and provides a thorough interpretation of the public health implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-86-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly calculates the additional deaths (110,000) and provides a thorough interpretation of the public health implications, matching the gold answer's reasoning and conclusion."}

For complexity-adjusted ROI, we separate costs into up-front ($C_{up}$) and ongoing ($C_{on}$), both functions of variety ($V$):\n   $C_{up}(V) = \\alpha V + \\beta V^2$ (quadratic to capture increasing complexity costs)\n   $C_{on}(V) = \\gamma V$ (linear ongoing costs)\n3. Revenue is also variety-dependent: $R(V) = \\delta V - \\epsilon V^2$ (revenue increases then decreases with variety)\n4. Total cost: $C(V) = C_{up}(V) + C_{on}(V) = \\alpha V + \\beta V^2 + \\gamma V = (\\alpha + \\gamma)V + \\beta V^2$\n5. Complexity-adjusted ROI:\n   $ROI_{adj}(V) = \\frac{R(V) - C(V)}{C(V)} = \\frac{(\\delta V - \\epsilon V^2) - [(\\alpha + \\gamma)V + \\beta V^2]}{(\\alpha + \\gamma)V + \\beta V^2}$\n   $= \\frac{(\\delta - \\alpha - \\gamma)V - (\\epsilon + \\beta)V^2}{(\\alpha + \\gamma)V + \\beta V^2}$\n6. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by $V$:\n   $ROI_{adj}(V) = \\frac{(\\delta - \\alpha - \\gamma) - (\\epsilon + \\beta)V}{(\\alpha + \\gamma) + \\beta V}$\n\nThis shows $ROI_{adj}$ decreases as variety increases due to the denominator's positive $\\beta V$ term and numerator's negative $(\\epsilon + \\beta)V$ term.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's derive the complexity-adjusted ROI expression step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Define the basic ROI formula\\nThe standard ROI formula is:\\nROI = (Revenue - Costs) / Costs\\n\\nStep 2: Express components as functions of variety (V)\\n- Revenue: R(V)\\n- Up-front costs: Cup(V)\\n- Ongoing costs: Con(V)\\n\\nStep 3: Account for complexity costs\\nTotal costs need to include both up-front and ongoing costs:\\nTotal Costs = Cup(V) + Con(V)\\n\\nStep 4: Derive the complexity-adjusted ROI formula\\nROIadj = [R(V) - (Cup(V) + Con(V))] / (Cup(V) + Con(V))\\n\\nStep 5: Explain the components\\n- R(V) typically shows diminishing returns as variety increases\\n- Cup(V) includes one-time costs like tooling, setup, and initial inventory\\n- Con(V) includes recurring costs like inventory holding, handling, and complexity-related overhead\\n\\nStep 6: Final mathematical expression\\nROIadj = [R(V) - (Cup(V) + Con(V))] / (Cup\n\nQID: Management-table-45-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-45-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly sets up the framework for deriving the complexity-adjusted ROI but does not fully develop the mathematical expression as comprehensively as the gold answer.

Thus, the algorithm is approximately 49.6 times faster on average, or 4860% faster.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's calculate the average speedup percentage of the proposed algorithm over the MATLAB solver:\n\nStep 1: Understand what speedup means\n- Speedup is how many times faster the proposed algorithm is compared to MATLAB\n- From the table, we have CPU times for both methods\n- The smaller time is better (faster)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the speedup ratio\n- Average MATLAB time = 7,738 seconds\n- Average Algorithm time = 156 seconds\n- Speedup ratio = MATLAB time / Algorithm time\n- Speedup ratio = 7,738 / 156 = 49.60\n\nStep 3: Convert to percentage improvement\n- Percentage improvement = (Speedup ratio - 1) × 100%\n- Percentage improvement = (49.60 - 1) × 100%\n- Percentage improvement = 48.60 × 100%\n\nStep 4: Final result\nThe proposed algorithm is approximately 4,860% faster than the MATLAB solver.

The maximum service time for an established patient is 12 minutes. The probability that a new patient's service time exceeds 12 minutes is the probability that a value from $U(30, 40)$ is greater than 12. Since the entire range of $U(30, 40)$ is above 12, the probability is 1 (or 100%).\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant service time distributions from the table\n- For Primary Care 2, established patients: [U(8,12), 48]\n- For Primary Care 2, new patients: U(30,40)\n\nStep 2: Identify the maximum service time for established patients\n- Established patients follow U(8,12)\n- Maximum service time for established patients = 12 minutes\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that a new patient's service time exceeds 12 minutes\n- New patients follow U(30,40)\n- Since the minimum service time for new patients (30 minutes) is greater than the maximum service time for established patients (12 minutes)\n- Therefore, P(new patient service time > 12) = 1 or 100%\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n- The probability is 1 (or 100%) that a new patient's service time will exceed the maximum service time for an established patient\n- This is because all possible service times for new patients (30-40 minutes) are greater than the maximum service time for established patients (12 minutes)\n\nQID: Management-table-203-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-203-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly identifies the distributions, calculates the probability as 1 (100%), and provides a clear step-by-step reasoning that matches the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-203-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the distributions, calculates the probability as 1 (100%), and provides a clear step-by-step reasoning that matches the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-203-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly identifies the distributions, calculates the probability as 1 (100%), and provides a clear step-by-step reasoning that matches the gold answer."}

The runtime of the parallel system is therefore the minimum of the individual runtimes.

For customers currently visited 3 times, one visit must be eliminated.\n\nStep 3: Assuming $n$ customers are visited 3 times currently, eliminating one visit per such customer would reduce routes by $n$.\n\nStep 4: From Table 3's 'Max no. of split' column, the maximum visits is 2 for this instance, suggesting most splits are already at $k=2$. Thus, imposing $k=2$ may not reduce routes significantly - perhaps by 1-2 routes if any customers have 3 visits.\n\nStep 5: The 0.49% improvement comes from allowing some customers to have 2 visits instead of 1.

The Voronoi cell for $C_i$ includes all provinces where $d(P, C_i) \\leq d(P, C_j)$ for all other camps $C_j$. \n\n1. **Initial Service Areas**: For the initial camps (Cordoba, Logronio, Salamanca, SEGSOSAZ ZA), we compute the distances and assign each province to the nearest camp. \n2. **Adding a New Camp**: When a new camp is added in UMMMOOPMOS SA, we recompute the distances. Provinces previously assigned to other camps may now be closer to UMMMOOPMOS SA, shrinking the service areas of the original camps. \n3. **Example Calculation**: Suppose Cordoba is at (0, 0), Logronio at (3, 0), Salamanca at (0, 4), and SEGSOSAZ ZA at (3, 4). A province at (1, 1) has distances $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$ to Cordoba, $\\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ to Logronio, etc. It is assigned to Cordoba. If UMMMOOPMOS SA is added at (1.5, 1.5), the distance becomes $\\sqrt{(1-1.5)^2 + (1-1.5)^2} = \\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$, which is less than $\\sqrt{2}$, so the province is reassigned to UMMMOOPMOS SA.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's solve this step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Initial Voronoi Cell Setup\\n- We have 4 initial camps located in:\\n  * Cordoba\\n  * Logronio\\n  * Salamanca\\n  * SEGSOSAZ ZA\\n- Each cell boundary is determined by the perpendicular bisector of the line connecting two adjacent camp locations\\n- Any point within a cell is closer to that cell's camp than any other camp\\n\\nStep 2: Current Service Areas\\n- Northern regions would likely be served by Logronio\\n- Central-western regions would be split between Salamanca and SEGSOSAZ ZA\\n- Southern regions would be served by Cordoba\\n- The boundaries between these service areas form the Voronoi edges\\n\\nStep 3: Impact of New Camp\\n- Adding a new camp in UMMMOOPMOS SA would:\\n  * Create a new Voronoi cell\\n  * Reduce the service areas of adjacent camps\\n  * Most significantly affect the service areas of Salamanca and SEGSOSAZ ZA due to proximity\\n\\nStep 4: Service Area Changes\\n- The new camp would:\\n  * Create new perpendicular bisector boundaries with all\n\nQID: Management-table-211-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-211-0\",\n  \"category\": \"PARTIALLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly describes the concept of Voronoi cells and the impact of adding a new camp, but it lacks specific calculations or coordinates as provided in the gold answer.

Derive the reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$ required to achieve the 'New' result, assuming the total size of added or deleted jobs is $P$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo achieve the 'New' result of $1+\\varepsilon$, the reassignment factor $r(\\varepsilon)$ must satisfy $\\sum_{j\\in J_{R}}p_{j} \\leq r(\\varepsilon) \\cdot P$, where $P$ is the total size of added or deleted jobs.

The expected waiting time $E(w)$ under random travel times is influenced by the headway distribution and transfer coordination. The deterministic model assumes fixed travel times, leading to suboptimal coordination.

The cost for item $i$ is: $$c_{i}(x_{i},a_{i}) = C_{i} + \\frac{h_{i}}{2\\lambda_{i}}(2a_{i}x_{i} + a_{i}^{2}),$$ where $C_{i}$ is the minor ordering cost for item $i$.

This suggests that the optimal policy is to replenish item $i$ only when its inventory level $x_{i}$ drops to zero, i.e., a zero-inventory ordering policy.

For $i = 6$, we need to compute $t(6)$, $a(6)$, and $b(6)$. From the table, $b(6)$ is not provided, but we can infer it from the labels of predecessors. Assuming $b(6) = L(\\text{predecessors of } 6)$, and given $L(1) = 0$, $L(2) = 1$, $L(3) = 2$, $L(4) = 4$, $L(5) = 5$, we sum the labels of predecessors of 6. If 6 has predecessors 3 and 5, then $b(6) = L(3) + L(5) = 2 + 5 = 7$. $t(6) = t(5) + L(5) = (t(4) + L(4)) + L(5) = ( (t(3) + L(3)) + L(4) ) + L(5) = ( ( (t(2) + L(2)) + L(3) ) + L(4) ) + L(5) = ( ( ( (t(1) + L(1)) + L(2) ) + L(3) ) + L(4) ) + L(5) = ( ( ( (0 + 0) + 1 ) + 2 ) + 4 ) + 5 = 12$. Assuming $a(6) = 0$ (no successors labeled before 6), then $L(6) = t(6) - a(6) - b(6) + 1 = 12 - 0 - 7 + 1 = 6$. However, the table shows $L(6) = 8$, indicating a discrepancy.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Initial and Final Values**:\n   - Initial lead time $L_1 = 51$ days.\n   - Final lead time $L_2 = 30$ days.\n   - Initial demand $D_1 = 12$ units/month.\n   - Final demand $D_2 = 12$ units/month (no change).\n\n2. **Percentage Changes**:\n   - Since demand does not change ($D_1 = D_2$), the percentage change in demand is $0\\%$.\n   - The percentage change in lead time is $\\frac{L_2 - L_1}{L_1} \\times 100 = \\frac{30 - 51}{51} \\times 100 = -41.18\\%$.\n\n3. **Elasticity Calculation**:\n   - Elasticity $E = \\frac{\\% \\Delta L}{\\% \\Delta D} = \\frac{-41.18}{0}$.\n   - Since the denominator is zero, the elasticity is undefined.\n\n4. **Interpretation**:\n   - The result indicates that the lead time is highly sensitive to factors other than demand, as it changes significantly even when demand remains constant. This could be due to operational adjustments or changes in production scheduling under Scenario 2.\n\nThus, the lead time elasticity is undefined, indicating that lead time changes are driven by factors other than demand.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Let's solve this step by step:\\n\\nStep 1: Understand the Lead Time Elasticity concept\\n- Lead time elasticity measures the percentage change in batch size relative to the percentage change in lead time\\n- The formula is: E = (% change in batch size) / (% change in lead time)\\n\\nStep 2: Identify the relevant data points\\n- Initial lead time (T1) = 51 days\\n- Final lead time (T2) = 30 days\\n- Initial batch size (Q1) = 20 units\\n- Final batch size (Q2) = 20 units\\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage change in lead time\\n- % change in lead time = (T2 - T1)/T1 × 100\\n- = (30 - 51)/51 × 100\\n- = -41.18%\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the percentage change in batch size\\n- % change in batch size = (Q2 - Q1)/Q1 × 100\\n- = (20 - 20)/20 × 100\\n- = 0%\\n\\nStep 5: Calculate the lead time elasticity\\n- Elasticity = (% change in batch\n\nQID: Management-table-77-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-77-1\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly defines lead time elasticity and misapplies the formula.

The number of firms that have adopted MS/OR in at least one area (ORAI ≥ 1) is 132 (ORAI=1) + 36 (ORAI=2) + 115 (ORAI=3) = 283. The probability $P$ is calculated as $P = \\frac{283}{495} \\approx 0.5717$ or 57.17%. This means there is a 57.17% chance that a randomly selected firm has adopted MS/OR in at least one functional area.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nI apologize, but I cannot calculate the exact probability from the data shown in Table 2. The table shows various characteristics of firms (like number of employees, sales, etc.) but does not contain direct frequency data about MS/OR technique adoption across functional areas. To calculate the probability that a randomly selected firm has adopted MS/OR techniques in at least one functional area, we would need either:\n\nStep 1: A frequency distribution or count of firms that have adopted MS/OR techniques vs. those that haven't, OR\n\nStep 2: The raw data showing which firms have adopted MS/OR techniques in which functional areas.\n\nWhile the table shows FUNCAREAS (Application areas) with a mean of 6.8 and range of 0-11, this appears to be about general application areas rather than specifically about MS/OR technique adoption.

Show the step-by-step calculation of expected payoffs for both players.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we first identify the best response for each player given the other's strategy. For the defender, the best response to an attacker targeting Target 1 is the patrol schedule with the highest defender payoff (100 in row 2). For the attacker, the best response to the defender's strategy in row 2 is to target the area with the highest attacker payoff (Target 4 with 20). However, in row 2, the attacker's payoff for Target 4 is -20, so the attacker would not choose Target 4. Instead, the attacker would choose Target 1, which gives them -100, but this is the least worst option. This suggests that row 2 is not a Nash equilibrium. We must check all combinations to find where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy.

Derive the conditions under which minimizing variance could lead to an increase in $E(w^2)$.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nMinimizing $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = E(w^2) - [E(w)]^2$ can lead to an increase in $E(w^2)$ if the reduction in $[E(w)]^2$ is more than compensated by the increase in $E(w^2)$. For instance, if initial $E(w) = 5$ and $E(w^2) = 30$, then $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = 5$. If after optimization $E(w)$ drops to 2 and $E(w^2)$ increases to 35, then $\\mathbf{Var}(w) = 35 - 4 = 31$, which contradicts the table.

Explain the possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe higher $\\tau$ value for AAI indicates a stronger correlation with Olson's ratings, but the lower significance level suggests less statistical confidence. This discrepancy likely arises because the AAI scores were available for only 19 out of 31 journals, reducing the sample size ($N=19$).

The adjusted R² of 0.1915 indicates that approximately 19.15% of the variance in frequency is explained by the model after adjusting for the number of predictors, suggesting moderate explanatory power.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"Step 1: Recall the formula for adjusted R²\nAdjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²)(n-1)/(n-k-1)]\nWhere:\n- R² is the unadjusted R-squared\n- n is the number of observations\n- k is the number of predictors\n\nStep 2: Insert the given values\n- R² = 0.24\n- n = 51 observations\n- k = 3 predictors\n\nStep 3: Calculate\nAdjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - 0.24)(51-1)/(51-3-1)]\n= 1 - [(0.76)(50)/(47)]\n= 1 - (38/47)\n= 1 - 0.8085\n= 0.1915 or approximately 0.19\n\nStep 4: Interpret the results\nThe adjusted R² of 0.19 is lower than the unadjusted R² of 0.24, which is expected as it penalizes for the number of predictors.

Step 2: Calculate RVs destroyed per cycle. With 25 platforms, each cycle can destroy up to 25 RVs. Step 3: Apply reliability and destruction probabilities. Reliability is 0.95, and destruction probability is 1. Thus, effective RVs destroyed per cycle = 25 * 0.95 * 1 = 23.75. Step 4: Total RVs destroyed = 50 cycles * 23.75 RVs/cycle = 1187.5 RVs.

For RSCT to be constant, the ratio $\\frac{[\\partial F/\\partial z_\\alpha]}{[\\partial F/\\partial z_i]}$ must be constant.

Average savings = $3.51M / 1298 ≈ $2,703.39 per store. Step 2: For 1994, total stores = 2763 (company) + 412 (franchise) = 3175. Savings = $8.54 million. Average savings = $8.54M / 3175 ≈ $2,689.76 per store. Step 3: For 1996, total stores = 2550 (company) + 1404 (franchise) = 3954. Savings = $16.40 million. Average savings = $16.40M / 3954 ≈ $4,147.70 per store.

Starting from the definition:\n\n$\n\\sum_{i \\in S} f_{\\mathrm{SV}}^{W}(i,S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\sum_{T \\subseteq S: i \\in T} \\frac{(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!}{|S|!} (W(T) - W(T \\setminus \\{i\\}))\n$\n\nRearranging the sums:\n\n$\n= \\sum_{T \\subseteq S} \\sum_{i \\in T} \\frac{(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!}{|S|!} (W(T) - W(T \\setminus \\{i\\}))\n$\n\nFor each $T \\subseteq S$, the inner sum over $i \\in T$ counts the marginal contributions of all players in $T$.

The coefficient simplifies as:\n\n$\n\\sum_{i \\in T} \\frac{(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!}{|S|!} = |T| \\cdot \\frac{(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!}{|S|!} = \\frac{|T|!

(|S|-|T|)!}{|S|!} W(T) = W(S)\n$\n\nThis confirms budget-balance.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's prove that the Shapley value distribution rule is budget-balanced by following these steps:\n\nStep 1: Recall that budget-balance means that the sum of all allocations equals the total cost/value of the coalition. In other words, we need to prove:\n∑(i∈S) f_SV^W(i,S) = W(S)\n\nStep 2: Substitute the Shapley value formula:\n∑(i∈S) ∑(T⊆S:i∈T) [(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!]/|S|! [W(T) - W(T\\{i})] = W(S)\n\nStep 3: Rearrange the summation by changing the order of summation:\n∑(T⊆S) ∑(i∈T) [(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!]/|S|! [W(T) - W(T\\{i})] = W(S)\n\nStep 4: For each fixed subset T⊆S, observe that:\n- The term [(|T|-1)!(|S|-|T|)!]/|S|! is constant\n- The sum ∑(i∈T) [W(T) - W(T\\{i})] equals W(T) - 0 = W(T) when T is a singleton\n- For |T| > 1, each W(T) appears |T| times (once for each i∈T), and each W(T\\{i}) appears exactly once\n\nStep 5: This leads to a telescoping series where all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only W(S) as the final result.\n\nStep 6: Therefore:\n∑(i∈S) f_SV^W(i,S) = W(S)\n\nThis proves that the Shapley value distribution rule is indeed budget-balanced.\n\nQID: Management-table-476-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-476-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly follows the steps to prove budget-balance, including the crucial rearrangement of sums and recognizing the telescoping nature of the series.

Number of deadheads = 2217\n2. Number of flights = 832\n3. Ratio = $\\frac{2217}{832} \\approx 2.664$\n\nImplications on the cost structure:\n\n1. The high ratio indicates a significant number of deadheads relative to flights, which will increase the cost term $\\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}x_{j}$ in the objective function since $c_j$ includes deadhead costs.\n2.

This means:\n- No facet should completely disappear after vertex removal\n- No new facets of lower dimension should be created\n\nStep 2: Key conditions for maintaining purity:\n- The vertices being deleted (from $v(t_{m-1}+1)$ to $v(t_m)$) must not be contained in every facet of any maximal face\n- The deletion sequence must not create 'holes' or lower-dimensional facets\n\nStep 3: Necessary conditions:\n- For each vertex $v$ being deleted, there must exist at least one facet that doesn't contain $v$\n- After deletion, all remaining facets must still be $s$-dimensional\n- The link of each deleted vertex must be pure $(s-1)$-dimensional\n\nStep 4: Sufficient conditions:\n- The deletion sequence must be a proper shedding sequence\n- Each vertex deletion must preserve the vertex-decomposability property\n- The deletion must maintain the Cohen-Macaulay property of the complex\n\nStep 5: Mathematical formulation:\nFor each vertex $v_i$ where $t_{m-1}+1 \\leq i \\leq t_m$:\n- $\\exists F \\in \\mathscr{C}_{m-1}$ such that $v_i \\notin F$\n- $\\dim(\\text{link}_{\\mathscr{C}_{m-1}}(v_i)) = s-1$\n- All facets in $\\mathscr{C}_m$ must have cardinality $s+1$\n\nQID: Management-table-421-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-421-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for maintaining the purity of the complex after vertex deletion, including the key condition about the link of each deleted vertex being pure (s-1)-dimensional, which matches the gold answer's requirements.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-421-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for maintaining the purity of the complex after vertex deletion, including the key condition about the link of each deleted vertex being pure (s-1)-dimensional, which matches the gold answer's requirements."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-421-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for maintaining the purity of the complex after vertex deletion, including the key condition about the link of each deleted vertex being pure (s-1)-dimensional, which matches the gold answer's requirements."}

Provide a step-by-step explanation using the LP formulations and dual solutions.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nThe CEC policy rejects a class $j$ request while the BPC policy accepts it when $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq R_{j} < \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t)$. This occurs in the scenario where $y_{j}^{*} < \\min(D_{j}^{t-1},1)$ in all optimal solutions of $\\mathrm{LP}(\\mathbf{n}, \\mathbf{D}^{t-1})$. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From Proposition 3, we have $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t) \\leq \\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n}-\\mathbf{A}^{j},t)$.\n2.

Under the assumption that the dual basis changes, Proposition 3 gives $\\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t) > \\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) = R_{j}$.\n4. Thus, $R_{j} < \\mathrm{OC}_{j}^{\\mathrm{LP}}(\\mathbf{n},t)$, so CEC rejects the request.\n5. However, BPC accepts the request because $\\mathrm{BP}_{j}(\\mathbf{n},t) = R_{j} \\leq R_{j}$.\n\nThis aligns with the third column of Table 1, where CEC rejects and BPC accepts.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nStep 1: Understanding the Policies\n- CEC (Certainty Equivalent Control) policy uses LP-based opportunity costs\n- BPC (Bid Price Control) policy uses bid prices\n- From the inequalities given: BP_j(n,t) ≤ OC_j^LP(n,t) ≤ BP_j(n-A^j,t)\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the Table\n- The table shows three scenarios for optimal dual solutions y*\n- The key difference in acceptance occurs in the middle column\n- When y* < min(D,1) in all solutions but ≠ 0 in some:\n  * CEC rejects the request\n  * BPC accepts the request\n\nStep 3: Mathematical Analysis\n- For BPC to accept while CEC rejects, we need:\n  * BP_j(n,t) ≥ R_j (BPC accepts)\n  * OC_j^LP(n,t) > R_j (CEC rejects)\n\nStep 4: Specific Conditions\nThe difference occurs when:\n1. The bid price BP_j(n,t) is just high enough to accept the request\n2. But the actual opportunity cost OC_j^LP(n,t) is higher than the revenue R_j\n3. This happens when there's a significant difference between the current state n and the post-acceptance state n-A^j\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nThe CEC policy will reject while BPC accepts when:\n- The bid price at the current state underestimates the true opportunity cost\n- The optimal dual solutions y* are strictly less than min(D,1)\n- The network effects of accepting the request are more significant than what the simple bid price captures\n- This demonstrates that CEC is more conservative in its acceptance decisions due to its more accurate assessment of opportunity costs\n\nQID: Management-table-619-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-619-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer correctly identifies the conditions under which CEC rejects while BPC accepts, matching the gold answer's key points about bid price vs opportunity cost relationships and dual solution conditions.

This ensures that the marginal contribution of any player $i$ to any coalition $S$ is non-increasing, i.e., $W(S \\cup \\{i\\}) - W(S) \\geq W(T \\cup \\{i\\}) - W(T)$ for all $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq N \\setminus \\{i\\}$. Under this condition, the game is a potential game, and thus admits a pure Nash equilibrium.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's derive the condition for when the equal share distribution rule guarantees a pure Nash equilibrium step by step:\n\nStep 1: First, recall that the equal share distribution rule is defined as:\nf_EQ(i,S) = W(S)/|S|\nwhere W(S) is the welfare for set S and |S| is the number of players in set S.\n\nStep 2: For a pure Nash equilibrium to exist, no player should have an incentive to deviate from their strategy. This means the utility of each player at equilibrium must be maximal given other players' strategies.\n\nStep 3: The welfare function is given as:\nW(a) = ∑_{r∈R} W_r({a}_r)\nwhere R is the set of resources and {a}_r represents the players using resource r.\n\nStep 4: For the equal share rule to guarantee a pure Nash equilibrium, the game must be a potential game. This means there must exist a potential function Φ(a) such that for any player i and any unilateral deviation:\nUi(a'_i, a_-i) - Ui(a_i, a_-i) = Φ(a'_i, a_-i) - Φ(a_i, a_-i)\n\nStep 5: The necessary and sufficient condition is that the welfare function W must be SCALABLE. This means:\nW(S) = |S| × W({i}) for any player i ∈ S\n\nStep 6: This scalability condition ensures that the welfare scales linearly with the number of players, making the equal share distribution fair and stable.\n\nStep 7: When this condition holds, the potential function can be defined as:\nΦ(a) = ∑_{r∈R} W_r({a}_r)/|{a}_r|\n\nTherefore, the equal share distribution rule guarantees a pure Nash equilibrium if and only if the welfare function is scalable, meaning the welfare of any coalition is proportional to its size times the welfare of any single player.\n\nQID: Management-table-476-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-476-0\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer incorrectly identifies scalability as the condition for guaranteeing a pure Nash equilibrium, whereas the gold answer correctly states that submodularity of the welfare function is the required condition.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-476-0", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer incorrectly identifies scalability as the condition for guaranteeing a pure Nash equilibrium, whereas the gold answer correctly states that submodularity of the welfare function is the required condition."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-476-0", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer incorrectly identifies scalability as the condition for guaranteeing a pure Nash equilibrium, whereas the gold answer correctly states that submodularity of the welfare function is the required condition."}

For an $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable project, the $S_{i}$-active policy is optimal for the $\\nu$-wage problem if and only if $\\nu\\in[\\nu_{i}^{*},\\nu_{i+1}^{*}]$. This is derived from the relation $\\nu_{i}^{*}=-\\frac{\\Delta f^{S_{i}}}{\\Delta g^{S_{i}}}$, where $\\Delta f^{S_{i}}=f^{S_{i}}-f^{S_{i-1}}$ and $\\Delta g^{S_{i}}=g^{S_{i}}-g^{S_{i-1}}$. The nondecreasing property of $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ ensures that higher states have higher indices, aligning with the economics law of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nThe MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ characterizes optimal policies for $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable projects in several important ways:\n\nStep 1: Index Definition\n- The MPI $\\nu_{i}^{*}$ is defined as $-\\frac{\\Delta f^{S_{i}}}{\\Delta g^{S_{i}}}$ for states $i\\in N^{\\{0,1\\}}$\n- This represents the ratio of marginal cost reduction to marginal work increment when activating state i\n\nStep 2: Priority Structure\n- For $\\mathcal{F}$-indexable projects, the MPI provides a priority ordering of states\n- States with higher MPI values should be given priority for activation in optimal policies\n- This creates a natural ranking/ordering of states based on their marginal productivity\n\nStep 3: Threshold Properties\n- The MPI defines threshold-type optimal policies\n- For any given resource constraint or price, the optimal policy activates all states with MPI above that threshold\n- States with MPI below the threshold remain passive\n\nStep 4: Resource Allocation\n- The MPI guides efficient resource allocation across multiple projects\n- It indicates where additional resources will be most productive at the margin\n- This helps balance work and costs across the system optimally\n\nStep 5: Dynamic Properties\n- The index maintains optimality properties as system state changes\n- It provides a dynamic decision rule that adapts to state transitions\n- This makes it particularly valuable for restless bandit problems where states evolve over time\n\nQID: Management-table-683-0\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-683-0\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate answer accurately describes how the MPI νi∗ characterizes optimal policies for F-indexable projects, covering its definition, priority structure, threshold properties, resource allocation, and dynamic properties, aligning well with the gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-683-0", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate answer accurately describes how the MPI νi∗ characterizes optimal policies for F-indexable projects, covering its definition, priority structure, threshold properties, resource allocation, and dynamic properties, aligning well with the gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-683-0", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate answer accurately describes how the MPI νi∗ characterizes optimal policies for F-indexable projects, covering its definition, priority structure, threshold properties, resource allocation, and dynamic properties, aligning well with the gold answer."}

For Waiter 1 (A), the table shows assignments during multiple intervals (e.g., 7:00-8:00, 8:00-9:00, etc.), but the constraint implies that only one of these assignments can have $\\alpha_{g s u} = 1$ and the rest must be 0. The table's notation '1 1 1' might indicate multiple assignments, but the constraint requires that only one interval is actually assigned per day. Therefore, the table must be interpreted such that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to a single continuous block of time, and the '1's represent sub-intervals within that block.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's prove that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to only one service time interval on Monday using the constraint ∑sαgsu = 1:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the constraint\n- The constraint ∑sαgsu = 1 means that for a given waiter g and day u, the sum of all assignments across service time intervals s must equal 1\n- αgsu is a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether waiter g is assigned to service interval s on day u\n\nStep 2: Examining the table data for Waiter 1 (A) on Monday\n- Looking at the row for 'Waiter 1 (A)' on Monday in the schedule table\n- We can see that there are multiple '1' entries across different time intervals\n\nStep 3: Applying the constraint\n- The constraint ∑sαgsu = 1 requires that when we sum all assignments for Waiter 1 (A) on Monday across all service intervals, it must equal exactly 1\n- This mathematically proves that Waiter 1 (A) can only be assigned to exactly one service time interval on Monday\n- If Waiter 1 (A) were assigned to more than one interval, the sum would be greater than 1, violating the constraint\n- If Waiter 1 (A) were assigned to no intervals, the sum would be 0, also violating the constraint\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n- Therefore, by the mathematical constraint ∑sαgsu = 1, Waiter 1 (A) must be assigned to exactly one service time interval on Monday\n- This constraint ensures single-interval assignment per day for each staff member, preventing double-booking or non-assignment situations\n\nQID: Management-table-58-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-58-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly interprets the constraint and applies it to prove that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to only one service time interval on Monday, matching the gold answer's reasoning.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "Management-table-58-1", "category": "CORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly interprets the constraint and applies it to prove that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to only one service time interval on Monday, matching the gold answer's reasoning."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "Management-table-58-1", "llm_grader_category": "CORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate's answer correctly interprets the constraint and applies it to prove that Waiter 1 (A) is assigned to only one service time interval on Monday, matching the gold answer's reasoning."}

This reduces the present value of each cash flow $C_{n t}$ in the sum. Consequently, the overall price $P$ will decrease because the average of the discounted cash flows is lower. The magnitude of the price decrease depends on the specific cash flow structure and the original OAS, but the direction is unambiguously downward.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\nLet's analyze how a 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in OAS would affect the MBS price:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the OAS Model Components\n- The price (P) is the average of discounted cash flows across N scenarios\n- Each cash flow (C_nt) is discounted using factor d_nt\n- The discount factor includes spot rates (r_nj) plus the OAS\n- A 50bp increase means adding 0.0050 to the current OAS\n\nStep 2: Impact on Discount Factors\n- When OAS increases by 50bp, each term (1 + r_nj + OAS) becomes (1 + r_nj + OAS + 0.0050)\n- This makes each discount factor d_nt smaller because we're dividing by larger numbers\n- The effect compounds over time since d_nt is a product of multiple discount terms\n\nStep 3: Mathematical Effect\n- For each period j: (1 + r_nj + OAS)^-1 > (1 + r_nj + OAS + 0.0050)^-1\n- This means each d_nt will decrease\n- When d_nt decreases, the present value of each cash flow C_nt decreases\n- The total price P, being a sum of these present values, will decrease\n\nStep 4: Price Impact\n- The higher discount rate will reduce the present value of all future cash flows\n- The effect will be more pronounced for cash flows further in the future\n- Given the long WAM of 315 months shown in the table, the impact will be significant\n- Based on typical MBS duration characteristics, a 50bp increase in OAS would likely decrease the price by roughly 1-2 points, though the exact amount depends on the specific security characteristics\n\nQID: Management-table-259-1\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"Management-table-259-1\",\n  \"category\": \"CORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate's answer correctly follows the mathematical reasoning of the OAS model, accurately describing how an increase in OAS leads to smaller discount factors and thus a decrease in the MBS price.

The T² statistic is given by $T^2 = n(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)^T S^{-1} (\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)$. Under the null hypothesis of in-control process, $T^2$ follows a scaled F-distribution: $\\frac{n - p}{p(n - 1)} T^2 \\sim F_{p, n - p}$. The expected value of $T^2$ is derived as follows:\n1. The expected value of an F-distributed random variable $F_{p, n - p}$ is $\\frac{n - p}{n - p - 2}$ for $n - p > 2$.\n2.

By Theorem 5.6, weak vertex-decomposability implies a polynomial upper bound on the diameter function $\\Delta$. Specifically, the diameter $\\Delta$ of the complex is bounded by $2(n-s-1)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. This follows from the fact that weak vertex-decomposability allows for a shedding order of vertices, which in turn ensures that the ridge-path between any two facets has a length polynomial in $n$.

Verify that the sum of these values aligns with the total enplanements provided.\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nTo calculate the total number of origination-and-destination passengers for each airport category, we use the formula $O = \\frac{R \\times T}{100}$. For example, for the 'Large connecting' category: $O = \\frac{46.2 \\times 203.53}{100} = 94.03$ million passengers. Similarly, for 'Large origination-and-destination': $O = \\frac{79.3 \\times 93.89}{100} = 74.46$ million passengers. For 'Large-medium connecting': $O = \\frac{44.8 \\times 93.01}{100} = 41.67$ million passengers.
