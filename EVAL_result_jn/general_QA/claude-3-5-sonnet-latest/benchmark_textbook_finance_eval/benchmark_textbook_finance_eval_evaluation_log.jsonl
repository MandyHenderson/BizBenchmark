Why do bond prices fall when interest rates rise?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\n1. **Inverse Relationship**: Bond prices and market interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest rates rise, the present value of future cash flows (coupons and principal) decreases because they are discounted at a higher rate.\n2. **Opportunity Cost**: Higher market rates make existing bonds with lower coupon rates less attractive, leading to a decline in their prices to match the new yield environment.\n3. **Duration Effect**: Longer-term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes due to the longer duration of cash flows, which are discounted more heavily.\n\nCANDIDATE_ANSWER:\n<EMPTY CANDIDATE ANSWER>\n\nQID: textbook-117-32-0-2\n", "llm_grader_raw_response": "```json\n{\n  \"qid\": \"textbook-117-32-0-2\",\n  \"category\": \"INCORRECT\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The candidate provided no answer, which is incorrect for a question that has a clear and detailed gold answer.\"\n}\n```", "llm_grader_repaired_and_parsed_response": {"qid": "textbook-117-32-0-2", "category": "INCORRECT", "explanation": "The candidate provided no answer, which is incorrect for a question that has a clear and detailed gold answer."}, "llm_echoed_qid": "textbook-117-32-0-2", "llm_grader_category": "INCORRECT", "llm_grader_explanation": "The candidate provided no answer, which is incorrect for a question that has a clear and detailed gold answer."}

Why does the MR curve lie below the AR curve?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\nUnder imperfect competition, the AR curve is downward-sloping, implying $f^{\\prime}(Q) < 0$. From the general relationship $MR - AR = Q f^{\\prime}(Q)$, since $f^{\\prime}(Q) < 0$, $MR - AR < 0$.

Explain the conditions under which monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy in the ISLM model.

Why do economists prefer chain-weighted measures of real GDP over traditional fixed-base-year measures?\n\nGOLD_ANSWER:\n1. **Outdated Prices Issue**: Fixed-base-year measures use prices from a single base year, which can become outdated over time, especially for goods with rapidly changing prices (e.g., computers).\n2. **Chain-Weighted Solution**: Chain-weighted measures update the base year continuously, using average prices from adjacent years.
