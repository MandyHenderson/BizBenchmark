It remains to observe that $h_{P}=h_{Q}$ because $P\\approx Q$ . w \n\nAs a next step, we investigate the impact of the existence of unambiguous events on the preceding result. We start with an intermediate result showing that if a capacity is law invariant on unambiguous events with respect to two none­ quivalent finitely additive probabilities, one of which has convex range, then every event is actually unambiguous. \n\nProposition 5. Let $P$ and $Q$ be finitely additive probabilities such that $P$ has convex range, $Q\\ll P.$ , and let $v$ be a capacity that is $P.$ - and Q-invariant on unambiguous events. Then, either $P\\approx Q$ or $\\Sigma_{u a}(v)=\\Sigma$ . \n\nProof. Suppose that $P\\approx Q$ so that we find $N\\in\\Sigma$ ith $P(N)>0=Q(N)$ . We first prove the following claim. \n\nFor all $A\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v)$ and $B\\in\\Sigma$ with $0\\leq P(A)-P(B)\\leq P(N),\\mathrm{~we~have~}B\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v).$ \n\nTo see this, abbreviate $x:=P(B)$ , $y:=P(A).$ , and note that in view of the convex range of $P$ , we can select $C,D\\in\\Sigma$ such that $C\\subset N.$ , $D\\subset N^{c}$ , $P(C)=y-x,$ and $P(D)=x$ . As $P(A)=P(C\\cup D)$ and $A\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v)$ , also $C\\cup D$ is unambigu­ ous. As $Q(C\\cup D)=Q(D).$ , we infer that $D$ is unambiguous as well. At last, every $B\\in\\Sigma$ ith $P(B)=P(D)=x$ must also be unambiguous. \n\nNow, pick $A\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v)$ so that $P(A)=1$ , and choose $x$ so that $1-x\\leq P(N)$ . By (11), every event $B\\in\\Sigma$ hose prob­ ability satisfies $1-P(N)\\leq P(B)\\leq1$ is unambiguous. \n\nNext, select an arbitrary event $E\\in\\Sigma$ ith $P(E)=1-P(N),$ and note that $E$ is unambiguous by the previous argument. Using the claim once more in case $y=1-P\\mathrm{(}N).$ , every event $B\\in\\Sigma$ ith $1-2P(N)\\le P(B)\\le1-P(N)$ is unambiguous. If $P(N)\\geq1/2,$ , we have already proved that all events are unambiguous. Else, we iterate the argument to come to the same conclusion. w \n\nThe next proposition shows that the conditions for a capacity to be law invariant with respect to different probabili­ ties become much more stringent in the presence of nontrivial unambiguous events. Indeed, such a simultaneous law invariance can only hold in the presence of the special distortion functions encountered in Example 2. \n\nProposition 6. Let $P$ and $Q$ be finitely additive probabilities with convex range, and let $v$ be a capacity that is both $P$ - and $Q$ -invariant. Then, $P\\approx Q$ . In addition, if there is $E\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v)$ with $v(E)\\in(0,1)$ , then $P=Q,$ or for every $A\\in\\Sigma$ , \n\n$$\nv(A)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{P(A)=0,}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {\\overline{{2}}}&{0<P(A)<1,}\\\\ {1}&{P(A)=1.}\\end{array}\\right.\n$$ \n\nProof. As both $P$ and $Q$ have convex range, Proposition 4 implies that $P\\approx Q$ . Now, let $E\\in\\Sigma_{u a}(v)$ be as in the assertion. Because $v(E)\\in(0,1)$ , both $P(E)$ and $P(E^{c})$ are in (0, 1). By Proposition 4(ii), it follows that $v(E)=\\alpha=v(E^{c})$ . Finally, $E$ unambiguous implies $\\alpha=1/2$ . w \n\nWe conclude the section with a few additional remarks. To begin, let us observe that Proposition 4(ii) has a valid (immediate) converse. \n\nIf $v=h_{P}\\circ p$ with $h_{P}$ as in Proposition $4(\\mathrm{ii})$ , then $v$ is $Q$ -invariant for every finitely additive probability $Q$ such that $Q\\approx P$ . \n\nAt once, these capacities admit the representation \n\n$$\nv(A)=\\alpha\\operatorname*{max}_{Q\\in{\\mathcal{P}}_{P}(\\Sigma)}Q(A)+(1-\\alpha)\\operatorname*{min}_{Q\\in{\\mathcal{P}}_{P}(\\Sigma)}Q(A)\n$$ \n\nfor some $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ . By a straightforward application of Lemma 3, one sees that core $(v)$ (acore $(v))$ is empty unless $\\alpha=0$ $(\\alpha=1)$ , in which case $\\mathrm{core}(v)=\\mathcal{P}_{P}(\\Sigma)$ $\\mathrm{\\mathop{acore}}(v)=\\mathcal{P}_{P}(\\Sigma),$ ), the set of probability charges that are absolutely continuous with respect to $P$ . \n\nAnother immediate implication of Proposition 4 is that the law-invariant capacities whose reference probability is nonunique are never continuous as they must fail continuity at either $\\sigma$ or $\\Omega$ . Equivalently, if a capacity that is law invariant with respect to a convex-ranged charge is continuous at $\\sigma$ or $\\Omega,$ then the reference probability is automati­ cally unique. Notice, however, that the converse of the latter statement is false; the capacity $v=P$ is not continuous at $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ unless $P\\in{\\bf c a}(\\Sigma)$ .",

To begin, let us observe that Proposition 4(ii) has a valid (immediate) converse. \n\nIf $v=h_{P}\\circ p$ with $h_{P}$ as in Proposition $4(\\mathrm{ii})$ , then $v$ is $Q$ -invariant for every finitely additive probability $Q$ such that $Q\\approx P$ . \n\nAt once, these capacities admit the representation \n\n$$\nv(A)=\\alpha\\operatorname*{max}_{Q\\in{\\mathcal{P}}_{P}(\\Sigma)}Q(A)+(1-\\alpha)\\operatorname*{min}_{Q\\in{\\mathcal{P}}_{P}(\\Sigma)}Q(A)\n$$ \n\nfor some $\\alpha\\in[0,1]$ . By a straightforward application of Lemma 3, one sees that core $(v)$ (acore $(v))$ is empty unless $\\alpha=0$ $(\\alpha=1)$ , in which case $\\mathrm{core}(v)=\\mathcal{P}_{P}(\\Sigma)$ $\\mathrm{\\mathop{acore}}(v)=\\mathcal{P}_{P}(\\Sigma),$ ), the set of probability charges that are absolutely continuous with respect to $P$ . \n\nAnother immediate implication of Proposition 4 is that the law-invariant capacities whose reference probability is nonunique are never continuous as they must fail continuity at either $\\sigma$ or $\\Omega$ . Equivalently, if a capacity that is law invariant with respect to a convex-ranged charge is continuous at $\\sigma$ or $\\Omega,$ then the reference probability is automati­ cally unique. Notice, however, that the converse of the latter statement is false; the capacity $v=P$ is not continuous at $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ unless $P\\in{\\bf c a}(\\Sigma)$ .",

The term 'decreasing minimality' is introduced in Frank and Murota [10, 11] as one of the possible formulations of the intuitive notion of fairness. Analogously, $z$ is an increasingly maximal (inc-max) element of $Q$ if its smallest component is as large as possible; within this, the next smallest component of $z$ is as large as possible; and so on. In general, a dec-min element is not necessarily inc-max, and an inc-max element is not necessarily dec-min. However, in Megiddo's problem in which $Q$ is the restriction of a feasible maximum flow to $S_{A},$ it is known that an element of $Q$ is dec-min if and only if it is inc-max. Fujishige [13, 14] proves that this equivalence is still true in a more general setting in which $Q$ is a base polyhedron. He also proves that the (unique) dec-min element of $Q$ is the (unique) square-sum minimizer of Q. In Frank and Murota [10, 11], the present authors solve the discrete counterpart of Megiddo's problem when the capacity function $g$ is integral and one is interested in finding an integral max-flow whose restriction to the set $S_{A}$ of edges leaving s is increasingly maximal.

For a generic signalling structure, G is freely generated and acts freely on the simplex (other than the Dirac measures); this implies that the ordering in which signals are received is of no consequence, and if two sequences of signals starting from the same prior lead to the same posterior, then those sequences are of the same length and consist of the same signals up to permutation. We then, in Section 3.2, reach the main result, which states that when there are at least as many signals as states, generically, the orbits resulting from the this group operation are dense in the simplex. The posterior distribution $\\phi_{m}(p)[k]$ is given by the formula: $$\\phi_{m}(p)[k]:=\\frac{r_{k}[m]\\cdot p[k]}{\\sum_{j\\in K}r_{j}[m]\\cdot p[j]}.$$",

As models incorporate more goals and implementation aspects, they grow too complex for traditional optimization, necessitating the inclusion of decision makers' judgments in the process of creating and evaluating alternatives.",

The production planning and control department used a microcomputer to store historical yield data and to recalculate the cumulative yield average for each product. This simple average forecast method tended to underestimate actual product yields for production processes that were undergoing continuous improvements (Figure 2). It was important that the yield forecasts be as accurate as possible. Pessimistic forecasts would influence the AMO to build more than actually required of some products or to transfer more products to a commercial company for production than necessary. On the other hand, optimistic forecasts would result in the AMO not meeting customer requirements as planned, which would require it to schedule additional product lots for future production periods. Because of the impending closure, the AMO might not be able to fulfill its contractual obligations and the customers would then be required to pursue less cost-effective alternatives to acquire their products. From a practical perspective, both types of forecast error were considered initially to be of equal cost; however, as the shutdown date drew near, the AMO considered a pessimistic forecast to be preferable because it provided a factor of safety relative to meeting requirements for a particular product. A comparison of findings from the four forecast models indicates that double exponential smoothing was the best model for predicting wafer fabrication yields (Table 1). Consistent with other investigations, we found that this model had a much lower forecast error rate than the other models under consideration. The double exponential smoothing model had the lowest mean absolute deviation and mean squared error values, the preferred underforecasted results (negative average error or bias), and mean absolute percent error values that were less than the somewhat arbitrary upper bound of 15 percent.",

Resources like clerical labor, on-line data input terminals, and computers have cost disparities between facilities (e.g., cheaper labor in Ireland but higher terminal rental costs in the U.S.). The model formulation falls under 'project selection' models, solved using CDC's OPHELIE II code (229 rows, 871 variables, 65 binary).

In short, SVA is a measure of what Deere or any project is actually worth to its shareholders. Deere calculates SVA as the difference between income and charges for the assets, using 12 percent as the charge for the assets. An increase in SVA affects the share price because it indicates increases in real earnings and the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio Wall Street analysts use to value shares.\n\nDuring the peak season (March through May), the reduction in inventory prompted Deere to double the replenishment frequency. However, because of the high volumes during that time, it incurred no additional transportation cost per unit because it could still ship full truckloads. In addition, the amount of aged inventory dropped from about $140 million to less than $50 million, allowing dealers to offer newer models to customers and avoid loss of revenues from discounted inventory, losses that the independent dealers and Deere share.

    "question_context": "The telephone register for New York State was designed to accept reports on or inquiries about child abuse via a single 7 day-a-week, 24 hour-a-day toll free (WATS) telephone. For the register to be successful, a necessary condition was a telephone reporting system that could adequately service the needs of the number of reports and inquiries that might emanate from those persons charged with the responsibility of detecting cases of child maltreatment and abuse. If the reporting system is not adequately equipped or staffed, then individuals attempting to make reports or inquiries will reach a busy signal or have to wait a lengthy period of time before being answered. If this occurs, it is very possible that reports or inquiries will fail to reach the register. As a precaution against having this occur in the New York State System, a team of faculty and students from the State University of New York at Albany were called upon to determine necessary equipment and staffing levels for the telephone reporting system. This paper describes the analysis that was used to determine current and future equipment and staffing requirements to adequately operate the reporting system. Although the project described here gives results specific to the New York State Child Abuse Center, the methods are applicable to any type of reporting or intervention (\"'hotline\"\") telephone system. Key formula: The probability of a busy signal is given by $P_b = \\frac{\\rho^c / c!}{\\sum_{k=0}^c \\rho^k / k!}$, where $\\rho$ is the traffic intensity and $c$ is the number of servers.",

The formula is given by: \n\n$$\\hat{R_{c}}^{2} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{N-1}{N-K-1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N+K+1}{N}\\right)(1-R^{2})$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of observations, $K$ is the number of independent parameters (variables + constant), and $R^{2}$ is the original coefficient of determination. This formula applies to regression models with a constant term. The equation shows that as the number of variables (K) increases, the expected shrinkage in $R^{2}$ during cross-validation also increases. Additionally, higher original $R^{2}$ values lead to smaller shrinkage. The ratio of sample size to number of variables (N/K) plays a crucial role, with higher ratios (e.g., 20:1) resulting in relatively little shrinkage compared to lower ratios.",

PM's implementation required significant modifications to Lyft’s dispatch and pricing systems, along with real-time algorithms for priority admission control to balance the number of prioritized drivers.",

This decision reflected in part the organizational structure of the Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation (NSF) up to early 1985, the interest and support for this conference having come from its Division of Civil and Environmental Engineering.",

The probability wheel is used with an initial mismatched sector size (e.g., much smaller than the subject's probability) to make early choices easier and avoid anchoring effects. The interviewer plots responses as points on a cumulative distribution (Figure 2) but avoids showing them to the subject to prevent artificial consistency.

Key formula: The central bias can be counteracted by deliberately eliciting scenarios for extreme outcomes, making them more cognitively available, thus increasing the variability of the assigned distribution. The probability wheel is used with an initial mismatched sector size (e.g., much smaller than the subject's probability) to make early choices easier and avoid anchoring effects. The interviewer plots responses as points on a cumulative distribution (Figure 2) but avoids showing them to the subject to prevent artificial consistency. Interval techniques are used to generate median and quartile values, and the session length depends on response consistency and subject comfort. Verification involves testing the subject's belief in the final distribution through graphical feedback and paired bets (Figure 3).",

    "question_context": "The production control mechanism used in the CB unit before the implementation of the lean control system can be characterized as 'push' because it did not explicitly limit the amount of WIP released to the shop floor. On the shop floor, the CB unit tried to meet the promised lead times using a priority system that was meant to control the throughput times of jobs. The priority given to jobs ranged from rush orders (highest priority) to normal orders (lowest priority). If a job was behind schedule, a planner increased its priority until it was back on schedule. This meant that jobs were continually sped up or slowed down to satisfy customers’ timing demands. The CB unit’s customers expect fast, on-time deliveries of high-quality products at a low cost. Therefore, reducing lead time (speed) and improving the service level (reliability) are of major importance. The proposed CONWIP/FIFO/TAKT system’s objective was to improve the control situation on the work floor.\n\nKey formula: The average processing time per operation was approximately 32 minutes, but with large differences between operations on the various machines and substantial processing variability on each machine. The CB unit operates on a two eight-hour shift pattern (a morning shift and an evening shift). Despite this pattern, three employees work only in the daytime because of health reasons; thus, they work during part of both shifts. Depending on the time of the day, between five and nine workers are available for production activities. Because more machines than workers are available, the CB unit can be characterized as a 'dual-resource-constrained' job shop.",

One such analysis for a commodity identified a swing of $\\10$ million from use of domestic vendors only to the allowance of up to 100 percent use of foreign vendors.",

This provides a prescription that provides each unit no less facility space than it has in the status quo. For implementation, the modification adds an additional facility condition, vapor. If there is an existing facility shortage, currently stationed units partially occupy vapor-condition (nonexistent) facilities. Units exit vapor-condition facilities first if they are relocated. Upon being vacated, these vapor facilities are no longer available to units. This allows nonmoving units, but not moving units, to occupy vapor-condition facilities. Richards (2003) reports more on modeling with vapor-condition facilities within OSAF. \n\nOSAF uses maneuver training land and range requirements from Army training circulars (Department of the Army 2004a). OSAF considers two types of maneuver training land: heavy and light measured in kilometer squared days, the measurement that the Army circular uses. We also find some shortages when we compare the total requirement for units currently stationed at an installation and the installation’s capacity. The Army cannot typically purchase additional maneuver land; therefore, OSAF allows a user-defined deviation between the requirements of the units stationed and the installation’s capacity. There is also a user-defined total deviation across all installations; thus, OSAF can restrict a new stationing prescription, for example, to being no worse than the total status quo.

Specifically, if $(\\underline{\\underline{\\alpha}}^p)_{p=1}^P$ and $(\\underline{\\underline{\\beta}}^q)_{q=1}^Q$ are integer bases of $\\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\\mathcal{L}_B$ respectively, then $(\\underline{\\underline{\\alpha}}^T \\otimes \\underline{\\underline{\\beta}})$ forms a basis for $\\mathcal{L}$. Furthermore, if the bases of $\\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\\mathcal{L}_B$ are reduced bases, the resulting basis is also reduced under a suitable monotone ordering. The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the basis $V$ under such an ordering is given by $(\\underline{\\hat{\\alpha}}^p \\otimes \\underline{\\hat{\\beta}}^q)$. Key formula: $\\operatorname{vec}(X) = (\\underline{\\underline{\\alpha}}^T \\otimes \\underline{\\underline{\\beta}}) \\operatorname{vec}(\\Lambda)$.",

A firm’s products with a good match between their process technologies and their product or market characteristics occupy regions of the matrix along the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal. As a firm’s products grow in volume, they pass through the typical stages of their life cycles and, according to the logic of the matrix, the manufacturing-process technology used in the company should be altered accordingly to match this progression. This is not to say that firms cannot operate in the zones that are off-diagonal; indeed, some do so. However, the farther off the diagonal, the greater the mismatch between product characteristics and process capabilities.\n\nSafizadeh et al. [1996] recognize that their study did not address the dynamics of plants with products advancing through their life cycles—an aspect that we believe was the original focus of the matrix. The other characteristic of their study is its unit of analysis: 'primary product line' produced in a particular plant. We, too, applied the product-process matrix framework at the plant level; however, we used all product lines produced in a particular plant because this is the reality most manufacturers face. We believe it is the existing diversity and the changes in the market characteristics of the products over time that typically cause misalignment.",

A firm’s products with a good match between their process technologies and their product or market characteristics occupy regions of the matrix along the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal. As a firm’s products grow in volume, they pass through the typical stages of their life cycles and, according to the logic of the matrix, the manufacturing-process technology used in the company should be altered accordingly to match this progression. This is not to say that firms cannot operate in the zones that are off-diagonal; indeed, some do so. However, the farther off the diagonal, the greater the mismatch between product characteristics and process capabilities.\n\nSafizadeh et al. [1996] recognize that their study did not address the dynamics of plants with products advancing through their life cycles—an aspect that we believe was the original focus of the matrix. The other characteristic of their study is its unit of analysis: 'primary product line' produced in a particular plant. We, too, applied the product-process matrix framework at the plant level; however, we used all product lines produced in a particular plant because this is the reality most manufacturers face. We believe it is the existing diversity and the changes in the market characteristics of the products over time that typically cause misalignment.",

The cover ratio, i.e., the ratio of the sum of the travel times of the lanes covered by a cycle and the duration of that cycle, favors cycles with little empty repositioning and waiting time. It is more likely to find cycles with a high cover ratio among cycles with only a few lanes.",

Note that any high-probability guarantee concerning $R e g(f)$ for any fixed arm $f$ with failure probability $\\delta^{\\prime}$ can automatically provide an overall regret guarantee with failure probability $\\delta=d\\delta^{\\prime}$ . A high-probability guarantee on low $R e g$ also implies low regret in expectation.2 \n\n2.2.1. Small-Loss Regret Bounds. The goal of this paper is to develop algorithms with small-loss regret bounds, in which the loss remains small when the best arm has small loss, that is, when regret depends on the loss of the comparator and not on the time horizon. To achieve this, we focus on the notion of approximate regret (cf. Foster et al. [23]), which is a multiplicative relaxation of the regret notion. We define $\\epsilon$ -approximate regret for a parameter $\\epsilon>0$ as \n\n$$\nA p x R e g(f,\\epsilon)=(1-\\epsilon)\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\ell_{I(t)}^{t}-\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\ell_{f}^{t}.\n$$ \n\nWe prove bounds on $A p x R e g(f,\\epsilon)$ in high probability and in expectation and then provide small-loss regret bounds by tuning $\\epsilon$ appropriately—an approach that is often used in the literature in achieving classical regret guarantees and is referred to as a doubling trick. Typically, approximate regret bounds depend inversely on the parameter $\\epsilon$ . For instance, in classical full-information algorithms, the expected approximate regret is bounded by logϵ(d)\b, and therefore, setting ϵ \u0005\tl\u0003 $\\begin{array}{r}{\\epsilon=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log\\left(d\\right)}{T}},}\\end{array}$ , one obtains the classical $O(\\sqrt{T\\log{(d)}})$ uniform bounds. If we knew $L^{\\star}$ , the loss of the best arm at the end of round $T_{\\O}$ , one could set $\\epsilon=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log\\left(d\\right)}{L^{\\star}}}$ l\u0003o\u0003gL\u0003?\u0003(\u0003d\u0003) and get the desired O(\n\u0003L\u0003?\u0003l\u0003\u0003o\u0003g\u0003\u0003(\u0003d\u0003\u0003)\u0003) guarantee. Of course, $L^{\\star}$ is not known in advance and, depending on the model of feedback, may not even be observed either. To overcome these difficulties, we can make the choice of $\\epsilon$ depend on ${\\widehat{L}},$ the loss of the algorithm instead, and apply the doubling trick: start with a large $\\epsilon_{\\iota}$ , hoping for a small $\\widehat{L}$ and\u000bhalve $\\epsilon$ when we observe higher losses; the latter is known as the self-confident approach and is introduce\u000bd in Auer et al.

Typically, approximate regret bounds depend inversely on the parameter $\\epsilon$ . For instance, in classical full-information algorithms, the expected approximate regret is bounded by logϵ(d)\b, and therefore, setting ϵ \u0005\tl\u0003 $\\begin{array}{r}{\\epsilon=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log\\left(d\\right)}{T}},}\\end{array}$ , one obtains the classical $O(\\sqrt{T\\log{(d)}})$ uniform bounds. If we knew $L^{\\star}$ , the loss of the best arm at the end of round $T_{\\O}$ , one could set $\\epsilon=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log\\left(d\\right)}{L^{\\star}}}$ l\u0003o\u0003gL\u0003?\u0003(\u0003d\u0003) and get the desired O(\n\u0003L\u0003?\u0003l\u0003\u0003o\u0003g\u0003\u0003(\u0003d\u0003\u0003)\u0003) guarantee. Of course, $L^{\\star}$ is not known in advance and, depending on the model of feedback, may not even be observed either. To overcome these difficulties, we can make the choice of $\\epsilon$ depend on ${\\widehat{L}},$ the loss of the algorithm instead, and apply the doubling trick: start with a large $\\epsilon_{\\iota}$ , hoping for a small $\\widehat{L}$ and\u000bhalve $\\epsilon$ when we observe higher losses; the latter is known as the self-confident approach and is introduce\u000bd in Auer et al. [9].",

However, this is challenging even for a single-hidden-layer network. The reason is that the local minimum we construct is nonstrict, and a nonstrict local minimum may disappear after a small perturbation of the problem parameters (which leads to a small modification of the optimization landscape).\n\nTo tackle this problem, we map the considered model to a single-neuron network, which admits a strict local minimum. Specifically, our proof consists of four stages. First, we show that the considered network has a suboptimal local minimum for generic X. This stage inherits the proof idea of Theorem 1, but the analysis is much simpler as we are considering a single-hidden-layer network. Second, we show that the constructed local minimum in the first stage corresponds to a strict local minimum of a one-neuron sigmoid network. This is done by 'merging' all the hidden neurons of the wide network into a single neuron. Third, we consider an arbitrary perturbation on the training data within a sufficiently small region. Because a strict local minimum persists after a sufficiently small perturbation on the landscape, the 'perturbed' one-neuron network also has a local minimum that is close to the original one. Finally, we prove the existence of suboptimal local minimum for the wide network with the perturbed data. This local minimum, correspondingly, is produced by 'splitting' the hidden neuron of the perturbed one-neuron network.

      "The Multimedian Location Problem on a Network Expl.md"

    "question_context": "From Theorem 1, it is clear that an optimal solution $U^{*}$ to $(B P_{n})$ gives enough localization information about $(P_{n})$ that we can localize an optimal solution of $(P_{n})$ to some vertices and blocks. That is, to solve $(P_{n})$ it suffices to consider only solutions to $(P_{n})$ which conform to $U^{*}$. We remark, since the localization conclusions of the Theorem are obtained by solving $(B P_{n})$ on the blocking graph, that no information about arc lengths of this network $G$ is used. Likewise, the only information about each block that is used is which vertices are in the block, and which vertices of the block are cutpoints. Therefore, for any two multimedian problems with the same blocking graph and the same block problem, the localization conclusions would be the same. In this sense, the localization information applies to a family of multimedian problems. Alternatively, we can view the blocking graph as being an aggregation of the arc structure of the original network $G$, since it has a similar but simpler structure. Thus, we can view $(B P_{n})$ as an approximation to $(P_{n})$. Information we obtain about an optimal solution to $(B P_{n})$ provides some information about $(P_{n})$ as well. There appears to be remarkably little literature on the use of aggregation in network location theory.\n\nThe previously best solved case of $(P_{n})$ is when $G$ is a tree, and our approach builds on results for trees, so we believe it will work best when $G$ is tree-like. If $G$ is a tree with $m$ vertices it has $m-1$ blocks (the arcs) and each block has two vertices. If $G$ is tree-like it will have almost $m-1$ blocks, and each block will have relatively few vertices (at most three or four). In this case, it is likely that our localization result will decompose $(P_{n})$ into a number of independent and relatively small problems, each of which will be easier to solve than $(P_{n})$.",

    "question_context_used": "From Theorem 1, it is clear that an optimal solution $U^{*}$ to $(B P_{n})$ gives enough localization information about $(P_{n})$ that we can localize an optimal solution of $(P_{n})$ to some vertices and blocks. That is, to solve $(P_{n})$ it suffices to consider only solutions to $(P_{n})$ which conform to $U^{*}$. We remark, since the localization conclusions of the Theorem are obtained by solving $(B P_{n})$ on the blocking graph, that no information about arc lengths of this network $G$ is used. Likewise, the only information about each block that is used is which vertices are in the block, and which vertices of the block are cutpoints. Therefore, for any two multimedian problems with the same blocking graph and the same block problem, the localization conclusions would be the same. In this sense, the localization information applies to a family of multimedian problems. Alternatively, we can view the blocking graph as being an aggregation of the arc structure of the original network $G$, since it has a similar but simpler structure. Thus, we can view $(B P_{n})$ as an approximation to $(P_{n})$. Information we obtain about an optimal solution to $(B P_{n})$ provides some information about $(P_{n})$ as well. There appears to be remarkably little literature on the use of aggregation in network location theory.\n\nThe previously best solved case of $(P_{n})$ is when $G$ is a tree, and our approach builds on results for trees, so we believe it will work best when $G$ is tree-like. If $G$ is a tree with $m$ vertices it has $m-1$ blocks (the arcs) and each block has two vertices. If $G$ is tree-like it will have almost $m-1$ blocks, and each block will have relatively few vertices (at most three or four). In this case, it is likely that our localization result will decompose $(P_{n})$ into a number of independent and relatively small problems, each of which will be easier to solve than $(P_{n})$.",

Euclid's inability to prove this led to its acceptance as a postulate. Centuries later, Saccheri's exploration of the opposite assumption revealed non-Euclidean geometries, initially dismissed as mathematical oddities but later found applicable in physics. This historical shift underscores the importance of questioning obvious assumptions and exploring alternative models. In management, this translates to challenging traditional operational postulates, such as reversing the sequence of orders and production schedules in manufacturing, to uncover more efficient processes. The key lesson is the value of flexibility in thinking, provided that all assumptions are explicitly stated to avoid contradictions and enable rigorous exploration of alternatives.

    "question_context_used": "The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry states that if two lines intersect a third at right angles, they will never meet, equivalent to the sum of a triangle's angles being exactly $180^{\\circ}$. Euclid's inability to prove this led to its acceptance as a postulate. Centuries later, Saccheri's exploration of the opposite assumption revealed non-Euclidean geometries, initially dismissed as mathematical oddities but later found applicable in physics. This historical shift underscores the importance of questioning obvious assumptions and exploring alternative models. In management, this translates to challenging traditional operational postulates, such as reversing the sequence of orders and production schedules in manufacturing, to uncover more efficient processes. The key lesson is the value of flexibility in thinking, provided that all assumptions are explicitly stated to avoid contradictions and enable rigorous exploration of alternatives.

The key equations for this decomposition are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathrm{Min~Obj}}&{{=}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i,k}\\bigg\\{r_{i k}S_{i k}+\\frac{H_{i k}z_{i k}}{2}\\bigg(1-\\frac{S_{i k}}{P_{i}}\\bigg)+K_{i k}\\frac{S_{i k}}{z_{i k}}\\bigg\\}}}\\\\ &{{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad+\\displaystyle\\sum_{i,j,k}\\bigg[\\frac{1}{2}(H_{i k}+G_{j k})X_{i j k}+C_{i j}Y_{i j k}+I_{j k}\\frac{Y_{i j k}}{X_{i j k}}\\bigg]}}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle0\\leq\\sum_{k}S_{i k}u_{i k}\\leq Q_{i},\\quad\\forall i=1,2,\\dots,m,}&{\\qquad\\mathrm{(6b)},}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\sum_{k}S_{i k}=\\sum W_{i j},\\quad\\forall i=1,2,\\dots,m,}&{\\qquad\\mathrm{(22}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\sum_{i}W_{i j}=\\sum_{k}D_{j k},\\quad\\forall j=1,2,\\dots,n,}&{\\qquad\\mathrm{(23)}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\sum_{k}Y_{i j k}=W_{i j},\\quad\\forall i=1,2,\\dots,m;j=1,2,\\dots,n,}\\end{array}\n$$",

Key formula: For densities with a characteristic function of bounded support and $k$th moment bounded by a given constant, Nyquist's theorem can be exploited to yield a generator with $O(n^{1/(k-1)})$ expected cost. The Lipschitz class, defined by $|f(x)-f(y)|\\leqslant C|x-y|$, allows efficient generation by inferring $f(x)$ from nearby points due to smoothness. The standard rejection method, when applied $n$ times, results in linear growth of expected global cost, as the expected number of evaluations per variate is a positive constant.",

Remarkably, choosing minimization of a combination of average waiting time and travel time as the objective function for the real-time problem yielded the lowest end-of-day waiting in excess of 60 minutes (van de Klundert and Wormer 2010). Figure 1 shows the simulation results of the three solution approaches in terms of end-of-day performance as request arrival rates increase. The three approaches perform equally well when the arrival rate of requests is one per three minutes or less. At higher arrival rates, the multiserver policy performs substantially worse than the other approaches. The set-partitioning approach delivers slightly lower average end-of-day waiting times than the bipartite matching approach. Figure 2 displays the waiting-time results for instances in which the expected number of incidents per hour are 21.6 and 36.0, respectively.

Very few books and courses tell them how to obtain good estimates of the unit holding and ordering costs (not to mention the shortage costs). Most practitioners prefer to use the concept of service level than embark into the tribulations of estimating an intangible shortage cost. A distinction between total and marginal costs is seldom made. Theoretically, one should use the marginal ordering and holding costs. The remaining fixed cost components are essentially constants that drop out from the total cost expression when derivatives are taken to determine the optimal policy. The marginal approach is justified if the resultant policy does not require a change in fixed expenditures (e.g., floor space, personnel, etc.). However, the result is an order quantity considerably higher than if total costs were used. This creates a higher inventory investment, which makes the acceptance of the results by the customer less likely. \n\nPoisson has the distinct advantage of not requiring an estimate of the standard deviation for each item, a cumbersome task for small (noncomputerized) users. In estimating model parameters one should compromise between data accuracy (desire for larger samples) and the cost of data collection. No matter how accurately the holding and ordering costs have been estimated, the aggregate inventory picture may not live up to the expectations of the user. For example, unavoidable deviations from the theoretical assumptions -— particularly with regard to leadtime demand —- may produce a higher total inventory investment or number of annual orders than expected. “Optimizing'\" each single item in inventory does not necessarily produce the best results (from a management viewpoint). Consequently, the ordering-to-holding-cost ratio should be viewed as a policy variable, whose proper manipulation can help achieve a desirable aggregate inventory position (e.g., total investment and orders per year).",

Third, an integrability condition must hold for any p ≥ 0, ensuring that the expected exponential of p times the sum of the agent's utility and the integral of χₛ is finite (Condition (iii)). The principal's problem then involves optimizing over this set Ξ to find a Stackelberg equilibrium between the principal and infinitely many agents in mean-field equilibrium. The mathematical formulation includes the condition:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(p\\left(|U_{A}(\\xi)|+\\int_{0}^{T}\\tilde{u}_{A}(\\chi_{s})d s\\right)\\right)\\right]<\\infty.\n$$",

Undergraduate students at Caltech were recruited, all of whom had experience in other market experiments. They acted as trucking firms in the auction and earned money based on their decisions. They earned money by winning bids on lanes for amounts above their costs, which we gave them (Appendix). For example, if the cost of providing service on lane AB was 300 cents and a student won the auction with a bid of 350 cents for lane AB, he or she earned 50 cents. On average, students earned $30 to $40 for a two-hour session. The experiments also tested the optimization program in real time; we were able to correct errors that had escaped the debugging process.\n\nIn the meantime, the NEX team scaled up the auction part of the test bed so that it could handle over 1,000 lanes. This potentially huge, combinatoric problem is daunting (even with today’s technology), but it was almost overwhelming in 1993. In theory, each bidder could submit a huge number (2 raised to the 854th power) of bids, possibly more than the number of stars in the universe. Practical factors, however, limited the number of bids submitted. In particular, in the actual auction, bidders submitted bids via spreadsheets on floppy disks. At the time, these spreadsheets limited what a bidder could do. The maximum number of bids submitted was 4,595; and bidders did not complain that they could not submit enough bids. Starting from standard algorithms with some front-end sorting and culling of orders, we created an algorithm that easily handled problems of this scope. The algorithm had no trouble finding the optimal solution in less than an hour. (Using today’s computers, that would be less than a minute.)",

In a similar fashion, if the frontier segment defined by units B and C is extended, the efficiency ratio for unit S is at a minimum. The upper bound efficiency is based on the point defined by unit C, and the lower bound efficiency is based on the local frontier segment formed by units B and C. The ability to compute efficiency bounds for units like S -- the rule rather than the exception in this application -- is the major contribution of Constrained Facet Analysis (CFA) to efficiency assessment.",

Key formula: An allocation is EF1 if for any two agents $i$ and $j$, $v_i(A_i) \\geq v_i(A_j) - \\max_{g \\in A_j} v_i(g)$, where $v_i$ is agent $i$'s valuation and $A_i$ is their bundle. The round-robin mechanism always has pure Nash equilibria that induce EF1 allocations with respect to true valuations. Mod-Cut&Choose for two agents guarantees EFX and MMS allocations at its pure Nash equilibria, unlike in the nonstrategic setting where it may not satisfy $(5/6+\\varepsilon)$-MMS for any $\\varepsilon>0$.",

The Plackett-Burman design allowed estimation of all main effects clear of any confounded two-factor interactions and showed that interaction effects were negligible. Compared to sequential one-factor-at-a-time testing (common industry practice), this approach demonstrated large benefits: it required smaller sample sizes (48 stores vs. potentially 64+ for fractional factorial designs) and provided more comprehensive information.

First, it defines the function H(m, z, t, c, Δt, V(m + Δm, z + g(c)Δt, t - Δt)) and considers policies c₁ and c₂ that maximize certain expressions involving H. The inequalities derived from these policies lead to the key inequality: |V(m, z, t + Δt) - V(m, z, t)| ≤ a(t, Δt) sup |V(m, z, t) - V(m, z, t - Δt)|, where 0 < a(t, Δt) < 1 - rΔt ≤ 1. This inequality implies geometric convergence, ensuring uniform convergence. The condition r > 0 and h(z)g(c*) ≡ 0 is also noted as a supporting assumption.",

This approach yielded innovations and strategic advantages, enabling the production of kayaks made from 100-percent-recycled plastic and a nearly waste-free packaging system. Key formula: The decision guide was framed as the implicit question: 'Are we doing this in as environmentally responsible a way as possible?' This guide was effective because it was applied comprehensively, clarified common goals, created mutual benefits, and was implemented by a skilled entrepreneur-leader. The case challenges the assumption that sustainable-design frameworks are a luxury for start-ups, demonstrating that resource-constrained entrepreneurs can achieve competitive advantage through informal decision guides.",

This paper will develop the necessary theory to prevent redundant solutions in the application of partial enumeration techniques to chromatic scheduling problems. The bulk of the paper is devoted to developing two algorithms to solve the chromatic number problem (finding the chromatic number of any graph) which is a classical problem in graph theory. Indeed, one of the most famous problems in mathematics is to prove that the chromatic number of any graph that can be drawn on a sphere cannot exceed four. This is the four-color map problem. The two algorithms developed here will make it possible for researchers to explore graphs for which it has not been proven that four colors suffice.
